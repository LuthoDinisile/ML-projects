    "**What are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) ?**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "RNN are described(by IBM 2023)as a type of Neural Networks that use sequential data for prediction analysis.RNN are used for Natual Language Processing, Speech recognition,Time Series analysis, etc.<br>\n",
    "**Sequential data** -This is the kind of data where a point in the dataset depends on another point(s) in the same dataset e.g a Sentence. A sentence is a collection of words with a contextual meaning.In a meaningful sentence, the next word in a sentence depends on the previous word.<br>\n",
    "In order to predict the next word, a RNN needs to capture and remember information or patterns from earlier time steps in the sequence to make accurate predictions or perform a specific task.The ability for a network to have this kind of memory is called a 'Long Term Dependancy'.The main issue with a simple RNN is that is struggles it to learn long term dependancy and therefore for long sentences, struggles to go back in memory to remember what the previous words were in order to predict the next word.Specifically with long sequences,where the RNN is repeatedly multiplying gradients to calculate the weights,if the gradients are greater than 1 this can cause an exploding gradient as this weights can exponentially grow with the number of steps.Similarly,when the gradient is less than 1,it can vanish as the weight reduces with the number of steps.These are called Exploding and Vanishing gradients respectively, which are one of the main issues about using a simple RNN. To address this issue an Advance RNN can be used, a Long Short-term Memory,which handles long sequences better.Regularisation tools like dropout can also be used to prevent this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**LSTM** is an advanced RNN with a good long-term dependancy,and therefore performs better in prediction than a simple RNN.In a LSTM,data flows through gates that help it choose which information is important to keep in the memory and unimportant/redundant words are removed,resulting in short sentences than before,hence the name is \"Long-Short\" term memory.This shortening of sentences prevents vanishing/exploding gradients,as a results of this, backpropagation is perfomed well and the model is able to go back in memory(and improve weights,thus reducing the loss function) to remember the sentence and predict the next word.\n",

    "**The Dataset**<br>\n",
    "RNN is useful for various Natural Languge Processing(NLP) applications, including text generation, autocomplete suggestions, and improving machine understanding of human languages.\n",
    "The main goal in this assignment is to train an RNN to predict the most likely word to follow a given sequence of words in a text.A book is a good dataset for this model as it has long and complex sentences with dependencies between words that span multiple paragraphs or chapters. This provides an opportunity to train the model to capture and understand long-term contextual information, which is valuable for next-word prediction.Additionally,books contain natural language patterns, idiomatic expressions, and grammatical structures commonly found in written text. Training on a books can help the model learn these patterns, making it capable of generating text that adheres to proper language usage..<br>\n",
    "For this assignment I am using a book titled 'The Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony(Volume 2 of 2) ' by Ida Husted Harper and it is available for public access on the GUTENBERG PROJECT website (link below):<br>\n",
    "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31125 <br>\n",
    "For the purpose of this assignment(functionality of the code),A portion of the book consisiting of over 157 000 words(excluding special characted) was extracted from the entire dataset.\n",

    "**The Analysis**<br>\n",
    "The Analysis of this dataset focuses on the perfomance of the RNN model that will be built,on how well it can predict the next word given a sequence of words(sentences).For this project,a sequence takes up 30 words as input,and the next word after that as the output.The Analysis aims to also compare the prediction accuracy/results from using a simple RNN and from using an LSTM,which is an improved RNN.In details, the analysis will be performed in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.Data Preparation:**<br>\n",
    "This sections consists of obtaining the dataset,and data wrangling(preprocessing).<br>\n",
    "This includes removing punctuation, and tokenizing the text into single words using a Tokeniser.\n",
    "Creating a vocabulary that consists of all unique words in the corpus and assigning each word a unique numerical identifier.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.Sequence Generation:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step input-output pairs for training for the model are created. For each sequence of words in the text, I created a training example where the input is a fixed-length sequence of words(30), and the output is the word that follows the input sequence.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Vectorization:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section I convert the tokens in my training corpus into numerical vectors using the to_catogorical technique.This will done to remove any ordinal implications that may arise from the sequenced data, and to allow for the correct computation of loss functions and gradients during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Training:**<br>\n",
    "First,my RNN's architecture is created with the specified parameters, the algorithms that will be used are :\n",
    "1.A simple RNN \n",
    "2.Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)  because it can capture long-term dependencies.\n",
    "My model with then be trained on the prepared training data. The goal is to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the predicted word probabilities and the actual next words in the training examples.\n",
    "Early stopping and dropout will be used to stabilise and improve training.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**5.Testing:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "After training, I will use trained LSTM model for next word prediction.\n",
    "Starting with sequence of words from the book, and then use the RNN to predict the next word.\n",
    "And then create a sequence from outside the book and see how well the LSTM model predicts.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.Evaluation:**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the quality of your model's predictions using metrics like perplexity, BLEU score, or human judgment.\n",
    "Fine-tune your model and experiment with hyperparameters to improve performance.\n"

       "'CHAPTER XXXII.\\n \\n MISS ANTHONY\\'S EUROPEAN LETTERS.\\n \\n 1883.\\n \\n \\n No pen so well as Miss Anthony\\'s own, can describe her delightful tour\\n abroad, and although her letters were dashed off while travelling from\\n point to point, or at the close of a hard day\\'s sight-seeing, and the\\n entries in the diary are a mere word, they tell in a unique way her\\n personal impressions. Because of limited space descriptions of scenery\\n will be omitted in order to leave room for opinions of people and\\n events.\\n \\n                               ON BOARD THE BRITISH PRINCE, February 24.\\n \\n      MY DEAR MRS. SPOFFORD: Here we are at noon, Friday, steaming down\\n      Delaware Bay. We got along nicely until 3 P. M. yesterday, when we\\n      came to a standstill. \"Stuck in the mud,\" was the report. There we\\n      lay until eight, when with the incoming tide we made a fruitless\\n      attempt to get over the bar; then had to steam back up the river to\\n      anchor, and lie there until nine this morning--twenty-four hours\\n      almost in sight of the loved ones! It is a break from all\\n      fastenings to friends to be thus cut loose from the wharf and\\n      wafted out into the waters. These long hours of delay have given me\\n      time to think of those left behind, and how very far short I have\\n      come of doing and saying all I should have done and said....\\n \\n From the diary:\\n \\n      Feb. 24.--The weather lovely; saloon cozy and pleasant with piano,\\n      flowers and canaries. There are only seven passengers, among them a\\n      Catholic priest, a dear little three-year-old child and a baby. We\\n      sent twenty letters on shore, written during the day we have been\\n      detained.\\n \\n      Feb. 25.--Today dawns with no possibility of communicating with a\\n      soul outside the ship, a lonely feeling indeed; but I am determined\\n      to get all the good I can to mind and body out of this trip, and as\\n      little harm as possible.\\n \\n      Feb. 26.--I sit at the captain\\'s right hand at table. The sea is\\n      perfectly smooth; I wonder if this broad expanse can be rolled up\\n      into mountains.\\n \\n      4 P.M.--The wind and waves are beginning to roar. The priest shows\\n      signs of surrender.\\n \\n      Mar. 2.--Sea calm and dishes no longer have to be fastened to\\n      table. It seems like freedom again. I can think of nothing beyond\\n      shipboard, can see no moves to be made when we reach Liverpool.\\n \\n      Mar. 4.--Winds fair, sea smooth, whole company at breakfast.\\n      Captain Burton read the church service. Rachel played the piano and\\n      led the singing.\\n \\n                               ON BOARD THE BRITISH PRINCE, March 5.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER MARY: At lunch the captain said, \"I\\'ll soon show you\\n      land! It will be Mizzenhead, the farthest southwest point of\\n      Ireland.\" This is the first pen put to paper since I wrote you at\\n      the Delaware breakwater, eleven days ago. Think of it, oh, ye\\n      scribbling fairies, almost two weeks and not a letter written by S.\\n      B. A.!\\n \\n      Well, we are thus far and have had no more than what the sailors\\n      call a \"stiff breeze\" and only two whiffs of that sort. Since\\n      Thursday the weather has been lovely--bright sun and crisp air.\\n      Rachel succumbed one night when the \"stiff breeze\" first opened\\n      upon us, and I felt a little squalmy. The next morning a sudden\\n      lurch of the ship took both feet from under me and I was flat on my\\n      back. The following day while I was lying on a seat, reading and\\n      half-dozing, the first I knew I was in a heap on the floor. Then I\\n      learned it wasn\\'t safe to lie down without a board fence in front.\\n      Again, in the evening I had taken the one loose chair in the\\n      saloon, drawn it under a lamp and seated myself very complacently\\n      to read, when lo, I was pitched over as if propelled from a\\n      ten-pounder! Three times and out--all in rapid succession--taught\\n      me to trust not to myself at all, but always to something fast to\\n      the ship. I haven\\'t lost a meal during the whole trip. Another time\\n      I should take a larger stock of oranges, lemons and other fruit.\\n \\n      3 P. M.--We have just been up on the bridge for a first sight of\\n      the Emerald Isle. So long as there was no immediate prospect of\\n      setting foot on land, I could get up no spirit to write or think. I\\n      have worn the old velvet-trimmed black silk dress right through,\\n      and it is pretty well salted. I should love to have Lucy and Louise\\n      and Maud along on this trip, with sister Mary, too. What a jolly\\n      lot of tramps we would make! Well, their one ray of hope is to\\n      \"pull through\" the free academy and get on their own feet. There is\\n      plenty of good in store for all who can bring themselves in line to\\n      get it. Holding a dish right side up to catch the shower is the\\n      work for each one of us. How much I do think and hope for the three\\n      nieces now entering womanhood. For Susie B. Jr., and little Anna O.\\n      and Gula, I shall think and hope by and by. As for the nephews, I\\n      do not forget them, but they\\'ll fight their way through somehow, as\\n      have all boys before them....\\n \\n      Dinner is over and an hour\\'s talk at table after it. The Englishman\\n      Mr. Mullinor, summed up: \"Your country will come to ruin from such\\n      doctrines as you woman\\'s rights folks advocate;\" and I have put the\\n      case to him to the best of my sea-brain\\'s ability. This is the very\\n      first time I have let my tongue loose. We expect to be in Liverpool\\n      tomorrow early, and then I will write you. Just take it for granted\\n      all is well with me, and I will try to do the same with you.\\n \\n Miss Anthony found at Liverpool a cordial letter from Mrs. A. A.\\n Sargent, whose husband was now United States Minister to Germany. She\\n welcomed her to Europe, saying: \"You always have the entree to our home\\n and hearts. Come and stay as long as you will.\" A note from Mrs. Stanton\\n to her \"beloved Susan\" said: \"I came up to London the moment I heard of\\n the arrival of the British Prince. To think of your choosing a \\'Prince\\'\\n when a \\'Queen\\' was coming! I am on the tiptoe of expectation to meet\\n you.... I write in the suffrage rooms surrounded with ladies.\"\\n \\n A week later the diary records: \"Left London at 10 A. M. for Rome,\\n Rachel and self, also Hattie Daniels, Alice Blatch and Mrs. Fanny\\n Keartland, five in all, three of the Eagle and two of the Lion, each\\n glorying in her own nationality!\"\\n \\n                               ROME, NO. 75 VIA NAZIONALE, March 22.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: Here it is a whole month tomorrow since we took a\\n      last glimpse of each other and scarce a decent letter have I\\n      written you; but it is fearfully hard work to find the minutes.\\n      There is so much to tell, and the spelling and pronunciation of the\\n      names are so perfectly awful.... At Liverpool we drove two hours in\\n      the Princess and Sefton parks and then went to the city museum,\\n      where the most interesting things to us were the portraits of all\\n      the Bonapartes--men and women, old and young--Josephine\\'s very\\n      lovely; and to the city library, which is free. There is also an\\n      immense free lecture hall, which was built for an aquarium but\\n      found impracticable, so it is an enormous circle, seated from the\\n      circumference down to the center, with a large platform at one side\\n      and every step and seat cut out of solid stone. Here the most\\n      learned men of the English colleges give free lectures, the city\\n      fund being ample to meet all expenses. The librarian, on hearing we\\n      were Americans, took great pains to show us everything. Of course\\n      when he said, \"We have over 80,000 volumes,\" I asked, \"Have you\\n      among them the History of Woman Suffrage, by Mesdames Stanton,\\n      etc., of America?\" And lo, he had never heard of it!\\n \\n      Thursday morning we took train--second-class carriage--for London.\\n      Mrs. Stanton was at the station, her face beaming and her white\\n      curls as lovely as ever, and we were soon landed at our\\n      boarding-house. Lydia Becker came to dinner by Mrs. Stanton\\'s\\n      invitation, so she was the first of England\\'s suffrage women for us\\n      to meet. Friday afternoon we glanced into the House of Commons and\\n      happened to see Gladstone presenting some motion. Spent the evening\\n      chatting with Mrs. Stanton--a world of things to talk over....\\n \\n      Saturday we went again to Bayswater to see Mrs. Rose--found her\\n      very lonely because of the death of her devoted husband a year ago.\\n      She threw her arms around my neck and her first words were: \"O,\\n      that my heart would break now and you might close my eyes, dear\\n      Susan!\" She is vastly more isolated in England because of her\\n      non-Christian views than she ever was in America. Sectarianism\\n      sways everything here more now than fifty years ago with us.\\n \\n      That afternoon I left for Basingstoke, the new home of darling\\n      Harriot Stanton, now with Blatch suffixed. Her husband is a fine\\n      specimen of a young Englishman of thirty. Sunday morning he took me\\n      in a dog-cart through two gentlemen\\'s parks, a pleasant drive\\n      through pasture and woodland, thousands of acres enclosed by a\\n      stone wall. When I said, \"What a shame that all these acres should\\n      thus lie waste, while myriads of poor people are without an inch of\\n      ground whereon to set foot,\" he replied: \"They would be no better\\n      off if all should be cut up into forty-acre farms and divided among\\n      the poor, for no man could possibly support a family upon one. The\\n      owners of these parks are actually reduced to poverty trying to\\n      keep them up.\" So you see it is of no use to talk of giving every\\n      Englishman a farm, when the land is so poor no one can make a\\n      living off of it. Of course this is not true of all England, but\\n      evidently its inhabitants must be fed from other countries. On our\\n      return I was conducted through the garden and green-house of Mr.\\n      Blatch\\'s father, where I saw peach trees in blossom and grape vines\\n      budding. The tree-trunks were not larger than my arm and I\\n      exclaimed, \"How many peaches can you get off these little trees?\"\\n      \"Why, last year, we had 250,\" said he. How is that by the side of\\n      our old farm harvest of 1,000 trees? And yet these English people\\n      talk as if they raised fruit!...\\n \\n      The next day I returned to London and Mrs. Stanton and I called on\\n      Rev. William Henry Channing at the West End, and had a two hours\\'\\n      chat with him.... He was very cordial and on our leaving said, \"I\\n      can\\'t tell you how grateful I am for this interview. You have my\\n      blessing and benediction;\" so we were glad at heart. Mr. Channing\\n      loves America above all other countries and feels it was a mistake\\n      for him to have left it. His elder daughter is the wife of Edwin\\n      Arnold. March 12 we dined with the son-in-law of William Ashurst,\\n      the friend of Wm. Lloyd Garrison--Mr. Biggs, and his four\\n      daughters. Caroline Ashurst Biggs, the second, is the editor of the\\n      Englishwoman\\'s Review and one of the leading suffrage women of\\n      England.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Very sincerely yours, Caroline A. Biggs.\"]\\n \\n      After dinner some twenty ladies and gentlemen came in and we had a\\n      delightful evening, but such a continual serving of refreshments!\\n \\n [Illustration: Mentia Taylor (Signed: \"Yours very sincerely Mentia\\n Taylor\")]\\n \\n      Tuesday morning I went again to Mrs. Rose\\'s and finding her\\n      bonneted and cloaked for a chair ride, I walked beside her, holding\\n      her hand, through Kensington Park. I hope and almost believe she\\n      will go back to America with me. I feel sure that we, who have not\\n      forgotten her early and wonderful work for woman and for freedom\\n      of thought, will do all in our power to smooth her last days....\\n      That evening Rachel and I went to see Irving and Ellen Terry in\\n      Much Ado About Nothing. The painting and the lights and shadows of\\n      the scenery were lovely, and I suppose the acting was good, but I\\n      can not enjoy love and flirtation exhibited on the stage any more\\n      than off. All passional demonstrations seem to belong to the two\\n      concerned, not to other persons. The lovemaking, however, was\\n      cooler, more distant and more piquant than usual.\\n \\n      Wednesday afternoon Mrs. Rebecca Moore, our old Revolution\\n      correspondent, took me to a meeting at Mrs. Müller\\'s, about the\\n      Contagious Diseases Acts--fifty or sixty ladies present--was\\n      introduced, and several invited me to speak for them when I\\n      returned to London. Miss Rye, who has made between thirty and forty\\n      trips across the Atlantic with little girls, taking over more than\\n      10,000 and placing them in good homes in Canada, was there and\\n      spoke. She said all her efforts could accomplish nothing in\\n      thinning out the more than 1,000,000 surplus women of the island.\\n      Not one seemed to dare speak out the whole of the facts and\\n      philosophy. Each promised, \"I will not shock you by calling the\\n      names,\" etc. Mrs. Peter Taylor\\'s reception that evening was an\\n      unusually brilliant affair. She is looked upon as the mother of the\\n      English movement, as Mrs. Stanton is of the American. She is a\\n      magnificent woman and acted the part of hostess most gracefully.\\n      Her husband is a member of Parliament. At eleven we went home and\\n      packed our trunks to be off for Rome on the morrow, half-regretting\\n      that we had planned to leave London....\\n \\n \\n                                                        ROME, March 23.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: It is noon--Good Friday--and just set in for a\\n      steady rain, so I will give you the goings, seeings and sayings of\\n      our company since leaving London.... We started from Victoria\\n      Station--second-class carriage, no sleeper--for a three days\\' and\\n      two nights\\' journey to Rome. It looked appalling, even to so old a\\n      traveller as myself, but I inwardly said, \"I can stand it if the\\n      younger ones can.\" The crossing of the straits of Dover was rough,\\n      the sea dashing over the sides of the boat, but Rachel and I went\\n      through the two hours without a quaver. At Calais we had the same\\n      good luck as at London--a compartment of the car all to ourselves.\\n      Here we were to be settled without change for that night and the\\n      next day, so with bags and shawl-straps, bundles, lunch-baskets and\\n      a peck of oranges, we adjusted ourselves. We breakfasted at Basle,\\n      after having pillowed on each other for the night as best we could.\\n      Now we were in the midst of the Jura mountains, and all day long we\\n      wound up and down their snowy sides and around the beautiful lakes\\n      nestling at their feet--through innumerable tunnels, one of them,\\n      the St. Gothard, taking twenty-three minutes--over splendid bridges\\n      and along lovely brooks and rivers.\\n \\n      We arrived at Milan at 7:50 P. M., when even the bravest of our\\n      party voted to stop over twenty-four hours and try the virtues of a\\n      Christian bed. Rachel and I shared a large old-fashioned room with\\n      a soap-stone stove, where we had a wood-fire built at once.\\n      (Remember that all the houses have marble floors and stairs, and\\n      are plastered on the stone walls, so they seem like perfect\\n      cellars.) We had two single bedsteads (I haven\\'t seen any other\\n      sort on the continent) with the same bedclothes covering both. Our\\n      big room was lighted with just two candles! We \"slept solid\" till 8\\n      A. M., when Rachel got out her Italian phrase-book, rang the bell\\n      and ordered a fire and hot water.\\n \\n      After fairly good steak and coffee, we five began a day of steady\\n      sight-seeing.... In the evening we went to the station, and here\\n      found a wood-fire in a fireplace and monstrous paintings of Christ\\n      and the saints on the walls. All who had trunks had now to pay for\\n      every pound\\'s weight. I had brought only my big satchel and\\n      shawl-strap. We were not so fortunate as to find a compartment to\\n      ourselves but had two ladies added to our number, while four or\\n      five men in the next one smoked perpetually and the fumes came over\\n      into ours. We growled but that availed nothing, as men here have\\n      the right of way. At Genoa the ladies left us--midnight--and two\\n      men took their places. These proved to be seafarers and could talk\\n      English, so we learned quite a bit from them. At ten we were halted\\n      and rushed in to breakfast. Sunday afternoon we reached the Eternal\\n      City and came direct to the Pension Chapman, tired and hungry, but\\n      later went to St. John\\'s Cathedral to vespers.... After dinner we\\n      were glad to lay ourselves away. We have a pleasant room, with\\n      windows opening upon a broad court and lovely garden and fountain.\\n      Monday we drove around the city for bird\\'s-eye views from famous\\n      points. Such wonders of ruins upon ruins!\\n \\n      Sunday Evening.--It is of no avail that I try and try to write-when\\n      the sight-seeing is done for the day I am too tired.... Last\\n      evening the Coliseum was illuminated--a weird, wonderful sight.\\n      Today, Easter Sunday, I have seen crowds of people reverently\\n      kissing St. Peter\\'s big toe. Tomorrow we go to Naples for a week\\n      and then return and finish Rome.\\n \\n \\n                                                   NAPLES, March 27.\\n \\n      Here we are, Rachel and I, at the Pension Brittanique, far up a\\n      high hill, in a room overlooking the beautiful bay of Naples. It is\\n      lovely, lovely! The little island of Capri, the city, the bold\\n      shores and mountain setting--a perfect gem.... We have a little bit\\n      of wood-fire with the smallest sticks--twigs we should call\\n      them--two sperm candles to light our bedroom and no matches except\\n      what we furnish. But 8 o\\'clock is here and we are all to meet for\\n      breakfast....\\n \\n      Yesterday was a lovely _May_ day, and our party drove to the\\n      village of Resina, which is built forty feet above the ruins of\\n      Herculaneum. There, with a guide, we descended a hundred steps and\\n      walked through the old theater, over the same stone stairs and\\n      seats which two thousand years ago were occupied by the gayest of\\n      mortals. Then we went to the ruins of Pompeii and ate our lunch\\n      under large old trees growing upon the debris left by the great\\n      eruption. We passed through the narrow streets, over stone\\n      pavements worn by the tread of long-buried feet, through palaces,\\n      public gardens and baths, temples, the merchants\\' exchange,\\n      customhouse and magnificent theater....\\n \\n      I have just received John Bright\\'s splendid address before the\\n      2,000 students of Glasgow University on being made Lord Rector. It\\n      fired my soul beyond all the ruins and all the arts in Rome or\\n      Naples. It is grand indeed, and reminds one of our own Wendell\\n      Phillips\\' address to the Harvard students two years ago.[14]\\n \\n \\n                                                   ROME, March 29.\\n \\n      _To Madam Susan B. Anthony, of New York, U. S. A._\\n \\n      MADAM: We had the honor to announce your coming to Rome some three\\n      weeks ago in the Italian Times. While we ourselves have an\\n      impressive appreciation of your distinguished mental acquirements,\\n      yet we would wish to carry to our numerous English-speaking\\n      subscribers on this continent some testimony of your presence in\\n      our midst. Therefore we place our columns at your disposal, and\\n      will esteem the privilege of presenting to the public any topic\\n      your facile pen may write. To this end we will wait upon you or be\\n      pleased to see you at our sanctum. With much respect, we are,\\n      Madam, your obedient servants,\\n \\n                               THE PROPRIETORS OF THE ITALIAN TIMES.\\n \\n      [Only English newspaper published in Italy.]\\n \\n \\n                                                        ROME, April 1.\\n \\n      DEAR BROTHER D. R.: We have climbed Vesuvius. One feels richly paid\\n      when the puffing and exploding and ascending of the red-hot lava\\n      meet the ears and eyes. The mountains, the Bay of Naples, the sail\\n      to Capri and the Blue Grotto are fully equal to my expectations....\\n      The squalid-looking people, however, and their hopeless fate make\\n      one\\'s stay at any of these Italian resorts most depressing. Troops\\n      of beggars beset one all along the streets and roads, and with\\n      tradesmen there is no honesty. For instance, a man charged some\\n      twenty francs for a shell comb, then came down to seven, six, five,\\n      and finally asked, \"What will you give?\" I, never dreaming he would\\n      take it, said, \"two francs,\" and he threw the comb into the\\n      carriage.... Saturday we took the cars from Naples to Palermo.\\n      Every mountainside having a few seven-by-nine patches of soil in a\\n      place, is terraced and covered with grape vines and lemon trees,\\n      the latter now yellow with fruit. On many I counted twenty and\\n      thirty terraces, each with a solid stone wall to hold the earth in\\n      place. It is wonderful what an amount of labor it costs to earn\\n      even the little the natives seem to care for. Our hotel here is an\\n      old monastery, and on one side of the court is the cathedral with\\n      its grotesque paintings. One becomes fairly sickened with the\\n      ghastly spectacle of the dead Christ. It is amazing how little they\\n      make of the living Christ.\\n \\n      On Monday morning we drove back over that magnificent road, and\\n      took the train to Naples. In the afternoon we went to Lake Avernus\\n      and into the grotto of the sibyls, the entrance to Dante\\'s Inferno.\\n      It was a dark, cavernous passage and with the flaring candles\\n      making the darkness only more visible, we could not but feel there\\n      was reason for the old superstition. The narrowness of the streets\\n      of Naples--and they are without the pretense of a sidewalk--leave\\n      the men, women and children, horses and carriages, funny little\\n      donkeys with their big loads, the cows and goats (which are each\\n      night and morning driven along and halted at the doors while the\\n      pint cupful, more or less, is milked to supply the people within)\\n      all marching along together in the filthy road, jostling each other\\n      at every step.\\n \\n      But we are back in Rome now and this forenoon we spent in the\\n      galleries of the Vatican. One is simply dazed with the wealth of\\n      marble--not only statuary, but stairs, pillars and massive\\n      buildings. We stop here till the 9th, then go to Florence.[15]\\n \\n      It is good for our young civilization to see and study that of the\\n      old world, and observe the hopelessness of lifting the masses into\\n      freedom and freedom\\'s industry, honesty and integrity. How any\\n      American, any lover of our free institutions based on equality of\\n      rights for all, can settle down and live here is more than I can\\n      comprehend. It will be only by overturning the powers that\\n      education and equal chances ever can come to the rank and file. The\\n      hope of the world is indeed in our republic; so let us work to make\\n      it a _genuine_ democracy, where every citizen--woman as well as\\n      man--shall be crowned with the one symbol of equality--the\\n      ballot....\\n \\n \\n                                                        ROME, April 5.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: How these anniversary days of our dear mother\\'s\\n      illness and death bring back to me everything, even at this\\n      distance and amid these strange surroundings. How she would have\\n      enjoyed these sights because of her knowledge and love of history.\\n      She could have told the Bible story of every one of these great\\n      frescoes. What a woman she would have been, could she have had the\\n      opportunities of education and culture which her granddaughters are\\n      having....\\n \\n      Tell Mrs. Lewia Smith her lovely piece of lace has been honored\\n      with the wearing in London and Rome several times and has been\\n      pronounced beautiful; but I prize it most of all for the giver\\'s\\n      sake. No one but she would have trudged through the slush and rain\\n      to get those splendid names to that testimonial. Nothing which came\\n      to me gave so much pleasure as those signatures of my own townsmen\\n      and women, from President Anderson all the way to the end of the\\n      list.... This evening Rachel has gone to a friend\\'s to study German\\n      so as to make our way with that nationality. What a jumble, that by\\n      just crossing an imaginary line one finds people who can\\'t\\n      understand a word one says!\\n \\n      Last evening we heard the grand Ristori render a part of Dante\\'s\\n      Inferno and a selection from Joan of Arc. Of course I couldn\\'t\\n      understand a word she said, but her voice, her gestures, her\\n      expression told the whole story. Then the music, vocal and\\n      instrumental, was the softest and sweetest....\\n \\n \\n                                                   ZURICH, April 23.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: We spent Friday night at Milan--there took our last\\n      look at Italian cathedrals, as we did our first, and its own still\\n      holds highest place as to beauty. We left early next morning and\\n      very soon were among the Alps.... The eleven hours\\' stretch was\\n      tiresome and disgusting inside our compartment, with from three to\\n      five stalwart men puffing away at their pipes all day long, and at\\n      every station rushing out for a drink of wine or beer. Our only\\n      chance of a free breath was to open the window, and then all the\\n      natives were in consternation!\\n \\n      We reached Zurich at six and, after a splendid dinner of roast\\n      chicken, green peas and lettuce, took a cab and called on Elizabeth\\n      Sargent, who is studying medicine at the university, and found her\\n      very happy and glad to see us. In the afternoon we took a\\n      delightful drive, as it was too cold and misty for the lake\\n      excursion we had intended. The highest Alps are still lost to us by\\n      fog and clouds. After supper we called at the American consulate.\\n      Think of our government supporting a consul in most of the\\n      twenty-two cantons of Switzerland!\\n \\n      Tuesday.--At Munich. We saw princes and princesses galore out\\n      driving this afternoon, but not the king. We leave tomorrow morning\\n      for Nuremberg, and reach Berlin Saturday, and there I hope to rest\\n      at least a week--but then the Emperor William must be seen, and\\n      lots of other curiosities.... If I could command the money, as soon\\n      as each of our girls graduated, I would take her first on a tour of\\n      her own continent and then through the old world, before she\\n      settled down to the hard work of life either in a profession or in\\n      marriage. Thus she would have much to think of and live over, no\\n      matter how heavy might be the burdens and sorrows of her after\\n      life....\\n \\n \\n                                                        COLOGNE, May 8.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: We left Berlin yesterday morning after a delightful\\n      week with the Sargents. I do not believe our nation ever has been\\n      represented at any foreign court by such genuine republican women,\\n      in the truest and broadest sense, as are Mrs. Sargent and her\\n      daughters. Mr. Sargent, too, touches the very height of democratic\\n      principle. Their association with monarchial governments and\\n      subjects but makes them love our free institutions the more.[16]\\n \\n      Our last evening was spent with the Frau Dr. Liburtius--formerly\\n      Henriette Hirschfeldt--a practicing dentist in Berlin since 1869,\\n      who studied at the Philadelphia Dental College. No college in\\n      Germany will admit women. Frau Libertius is dentist for various\\n      members of the royal family as well as for the Sisters of Charity.\\n      She says there are no dental colleges in the world equal to those\\n      of America....\\n \\n      May 10.--At Worms--where Martin Luther made his glorious\\n      declaration for the right of private judgment. There is a\\n      magnificent monument in a beautiful square; Luther\\'s is the central\\n      statue--a standing one; below, at the corners, are sitting Huss,\\n      Savonarola, Wycliffe and Peter Waldo, and on a still lower pedestal\\n      are four more worthies--one of them Melancthon.... We spent Tuesday\\n      at Cologne--visited the splendid cathedral and the church of St.\\n      Ursula. The latter contains the bones of 11,000 virgins martyred at\\n      Cologne in the fifth century. Whole broadsides of chapels are lined\\n      with shelves of skulls, which the noble ladies of the twelfth\\n      century partly covered with embroidery. Wednesday we took steamer\\n      up the Rhine at six in the morning and landed at Mayence at eight.\\n      It was a beautiful panorama, but not surpassing all others I have\\n      seen. The vine-clad hillsides, the ruins of the old castles\\n      (nothing like as many of them as I had thought) and the winding of\\n      the river were all very lovely. We visited the cathedral, the\\n      monuments of Gutenberg and Schiller, and then the fortress and the\\n      remains of a Roman monument erected nine years before Christ....\\n \\n \\n                                                   HEIDELBERG, May 11.\\n \\n      DEAR BROTHER D. R.: As I clambered among the ruins of Heidelberg\\n      Castle today, I wished for each of my loved ones to come across old\\n      ocean and look upon the remains of ancient civilization--of art and\\n      architecture, bigotry and barbarism. I am enjoying my \"flying,\"\\n      though I would not again make such a rush, but I am getting a good\\n      relish for a more deliberate tour at some later day. All of life\\n      should not be given to one\\'s work at home, whether that be woman\\n      suffrage, journalism or government affairs.\\n \\n      After being perpetually among people whose language I could not\\n      understand, it was doubly grateful to be in the midst of not only\\n      my countrymen but my dearest friends, and I enjoyed their society\\n      so much that I almost forgot there were any wonders to be seen in\\n      Berlin. But we did make an excursion to Potsdam--a jolly company of\\n      us, Mr. and Mrs. Sargent and their gifted daughter Ella, also the\\n      professor of Greek in your Kansas State University, Miss Kate\\n      Stephens. She interpreted the utterances of the ever-present\\n      guides, whose jabber was worse than Greek.\\n \\n      At Potsdam we were shown the very rooms in which Frederick the\\n      Great lived and moved and had his being, plotted and planned to\\n      conquer his neighbors. In the little church are myriads of tattered\\n      flags, taken in their many wars, and two great stone caskets in\\n      which repose the bodies of Frederick the Great and his father,\\n      Frederick William, peaceful in death, however warlike in life. We\\n      also visited the new palace where the present Emperor spends the\\n      summer. We saw parlors, dining-rooms, bedrooms, the plain, narrow\\n      bedstead the Emperor sleeps upon, the great workshop, in which are\\n      maps and all sorts of material for studying and planning how to\\n      hold and gain empires. I even peered into the kitchen and saw the\\n      pitchers, plates, coffee-pots and stew-pans. It was my first chance\\n      of a real mortal living look of things, so I enjoyed it hugely.\\n      There are rooms enough in these palaces for an army of people. All\\n      of these magnificent displays of wealth in churches, palaces and\\n      castles, citadels, fortifications and glittering military shows of\\n      monarchial governments, only make more conspicuous the poverty,\\n      ignorance and degradation of the masses; and all pleasure in seeing\\n      them is tinged with sadness.\\n \\n From the diary for May:\\n \\n      12.--Showering, but I walked up the mountain to pay a last visit to\\n      Heidelberg Castle, the most magnificent ruin in Germany. Its\\n      ivy-covered towers always will be pictured in my memory.\\n \\n      13.--At Strasburg. We have driven over the city, looked at the\\n      wonderful fortifications and explored the great cathedral with its\\n      famous clock. We heard the grand organ and saw 250 priests conduct\\n      the services before an audience of 2,000 people, nine-tenths women.\\n      Then to St. Thomas\\' church and the monument to Marshal Saxe.\\n \\n      14.--Left for Paris and had a beautiful ride through Alsace and\\n      Lorraine, the lost kingdoms of France. It made me sad all day; I\\n      wanted them returned to their own mother country. Theodore Stanton\\n      and his wife Marguerite met us at the station.\\n \\n      15.--Madam de Barron has invited me to be her guest while here.\\n      Such a delightful home and intelligent hostess! I have a charming\\n      room, and this morning the sun is shining bright and warm and the\\n      robins are singing in the trees. My continental breakfast--rolls,\\n      butter and coffee--was sent to my room and, for the first time in\\n      my life, I ate it in bed. What would my mother have said?\\n \\n      16.--Went to grand opera last night; magnificent house, scenery,\\n      toilets, equipages; but with my three \"lacks,\" a musical ear, a\\n      knowledge of French and good eyesight, I could not properly\\n      appreciate the performance.\\n \\n      17.--Theodore took me to the Chamber of Deputies to see how\\n      Frenchmen look in legislative assembly--very like Americans. Then\\n      we called on friends at the American Exchange and the Hotel\\n      Normandie, and I was too tired to go to U. S. Minister Morton\\'s\\n      reception at night.\\n \\n      22.--Called and had a good chat with Charlotte B. Wilbour, of New\\n      York; called also on Grace Greenwood; visited the Hotel des\\n      Invalides and walked in the gardens.\\n \\n      23.--Theodore and Marguerite took me to St. Cloud by boat and back\\n      on top of tram-car. Delightful!\\n \\n      27.--Today, Sunday, we went to Père la Chaise and saw great crowds\\n      of Communists hanging wreaths on the wall where hundreds of their\\n      friends were shot down in 1871--a sorrowful sight.\\n \\n      28.--At noon we went to the College of France to witness the last\\n      honors to Laboulaye, the scholar and Liberal. Saw his little study\\n      and sadly watched the priests perform the services over his coffin.\\n \\n      29.--Left Paris at 9 A. M., Theodore and his little Elizabeth Cady\\n      going with me to the station. The parks and forests are green and\\n      lovely, the homes cozy and pretty, France is a beautiful country. I\\n      have enjoyed the last three months exceedingly, but I am very, very\\n      tired; and yet it is a new set of faculties which are weary, and\\n      the old ones, so long harped upon, are really resting.\\n \\n \\n      _To Miss Susan B. Anthony_,                                  PARIS.\\n \\n      MADAM: Having been informed of your arrival in Paris, I take the\\n      liberty of writing to ask from your courtesy the favor of a short\\n      interview. I have since several years heard of all the work you\\n      have done in behalf of womankind, and I need not say how happy I\\n      would be to meet a person who has so often been praised in my\\n      presence. Hoping you will forgive my intrusion, and have the great\\n      kindness to let me know when I may have the honor to call, I am,\\n      madam, very respectfully, your obedient servant,\\n \\n      [Of Le Soir.]                                          A. SALVADOR.\\n \\n \\n                                                        PARIS, May 20.\\n \\n      MY DEAR MRS. SPOFFORD: I have just come from a call on Mademoiselle\\n      Hubertine Auclert, editor of La Citoyenne. I can not tell you how I\\n      constantly long to be able to speak and understand French. I lose\\n      nearly all the pleasure of meeting distinguished people, because\\n      they are as powerless with my language as I with theirs. We called\\n      also on Leon Richer, editor of La Femme. He thinks it inopportune\\n      to demand suffrage for women in France now, when they are yet\\n      without their civil rights. I wanted so much to tell him that\\n      political power was the greater right which included the less....\\n \\n      Miss Foster has gone to London for presentation at Court. She had\\n      the \"regulation\" dress made in Berlin--cream-white satin, low neck,\\n      _no sleeves at all_, and a four-yard train!... I have not decided\\n      when I shall go home, but before many months, for I long to be\\n      about the work that remains undone. The fact is, I am weary of mere\\n      sight-seeing. Amidst it all my head and heart turn to our battle\\n      for women at home. Here in the old world, with its despotic\\n      governments, its utter blotting out of woman as an equal, there is\\n      no hope, no possibility of changing her condition, so I look to our\\n      own land of equality for men, and partial equality for women, as\\n      the only one for hope or work.\\n \\n \\n                                                        PARIS, May 24.\\n \\n      MY DEAR RACHEL: I am glad to hear that you were not cheated out of\\n      teetering through the palace halls in front of the princess, and\\n      that you are not utterly prostrated by it.... I attended the\\n      suffrage meeting last evening, and heard and saw several men\\n      speak--_well_, I inferred from the cheering and shouting of\\n      \"bravo!\"\\n \\n      This afternoon I visited the tomb of Napoleon. It surpasses every\\n      mausoleum I have ever seen, not excepting that of Frederick the\\n      Third and Queen Louise in Berlin. It is well that his memory should\\n      be thus honored, for had he been born a hundred years later, when\\n      the march of civilization had pointed to some other goal to gratify\\n      his great nature than that of bloody conquest of empire, I believe\\n      he would have stood at the head of those who strive to make free\\n      and independent sovereigns of all men and all women. Everywhere\\n      here are reminders of the ravages of war, the madness of ignorance\\n      and unreason. I want to get away from them and their saddening\\n      associations. You will think I am blue. So I am, from having lived\\n      a purposeless life these three months. I don\\'t know but the women\\n      of America, myself in particular, will be the greater and grander\\n      for it, but I can not yet see how this is to be....\\n \\n \\n                                                   LONDON, June 7.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: For the hundredth time I am going to beg you to\\n      shut up the house and come over here. It does seem as if now we two\\n      sisters, left so alone, ought to be able to travel and enjoy\\n      together. You can not know how I long to have you with me; it hurts\\n      every minute to think of you treading round and round, with never a\\n      moment of leisure or enjoyment. Surely you have given a mother\\'s\\n      love and care to our nieces for eight years, and now you can let\\n      them go out from under your eye....\\n \\n      Rachel and I came up from Basingstoke on Sunday to attend a small\\n      reception at Mrs. Jacob Bright\\'s. Her husband has championed woman\\n      suffrage in Parliament for years, and she has led the few who have\\n      dared say, \"And married women, too, should have the franchise.\"\\n      When the powers that be forbade her to include married women in the\\n      Parliamentary Suffrage Bill now pending, Mrs. Bright withdrew and\\n      started a bill for their property rights, which was passed last\\n      session and is now in force.\\n \\n      [Illustration: Autograph: \"With kindest regards from Mr. Bright and\\n      myself, yours very truly, Ursula M. Bright\"]\\n \\n      Monday morning we went to Bedford Park and spent two hours at\\n      Moncure D. Conway\\'s. His charming wife read us what a delegate here\\n      from the American Unitarians says of Emerson, Alcott, Frothingham\\n      and George Ripley--that all are wearying of their early theories\\n      and theologies and returning to the old faith. Today I had an hour\\n      with William Henry Channing, and he virtually told me this was true\\n      of himself! I exclaimed: \"Do you mean to say that you have returned\\n      to the belief in the immaculate conception of Jesus and in the\\n      miracles--that you no longer explain all these things as you used\\n      to do in your Bible readings at Rochester?\" He replied: \"I never\\n      disbelieved in miracles. Man\\'s levelling and tunnelling the\\n      mountains is a miracle.\" Well, I was stunned and left. Even if all\\n      these grand men, in old age, or when broken in body, decide that\\n      the conclusions of their early and vigorous manhood were false,\\n      which shall we accept as most likely to be true--the strong or the\\n      weakened thought? It is very disheartening if we are so constituted\\n      that with our deepest, sincerest study we grope and dwell in error\\n      through our threescore and ten, and after those allotted years find\\n      all we believed fact to be mere hallucination. It is--it must\\n      be--simply the waning intellect returning to childish teachings.\\n \\n      That evening we visited the House of Commons and heard several\\n      members speak as we peeped through the wire latticework of the\\n      ladies\\' cage. The next afternoon we attended a large reception at\\n      Mrs. J. P. Thomasson\\'s, daughter of Margaret Bright Lucas and wife\\n      of a member of Parliament. There we met the leading suffrage women.\\n      Wednesday morning I went to Tunbridge Wells--thirty miles--to see\\n      Mrs. Rose, who is trying the waters there in hope of relief.... I\\n      should have told you that I dined on Sunday with Margaret\\n      Lucas--John Bright\\'s sister--and lunched today with Mrs. Mellen,\\n      mother-in-law of General Palmer, of Colorado, president of the Rio\\n      Grande R. R.--an elegant and wealthy woman.\\n \\n \\n                                                   LONDON, June 22.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: ... Sunday morning we went to hear Stopford Brooke,\\n      a seceder from the established church. I could see no diminution in\\n      the poppings up and down, nor in the intonings and singsongs, but\\n      when, after a full hour of the incantations, he came to his sermon\\n      on the Christian duty of total abstinence, he gave us a splendid\\n      one. Before commencing he said that, from his request the previous\\n      Sunday, twenty members out of his congregation of 600 came to the\\n      meeting to form a Church Total Abstinence Society, and ten of those\\n      made special and earnest protest against the formation of such a\\n      society! Can you imagine the chilliness of the spiritual air in\\n      that church as he laid down the Christian\\'s duty of denying himself\\n      that he might save his fellow who had not the power to drink\\n      moderately?\\n \\n      Afterwards, we called on Hon. William D. Kelley, wife and daughter\\n      Florence, of Philadelphia. We also attended a reception at Emily\\n      Faithfull\\'s and met a number of nice people; then took underground\\n      railway for Bedford Park and had tea with Eliza Orme, England\\'s\\n      first and only woman lawyer--or as nearly one as she can be and not\\n      have passed the Queen\\'s Bench. Her mother was lovely and so proud\\n      of her daughter and glad to see me. Miss Orme has a partner, Miss\\n      Richardson, who is a member of the London school board and has\\n      visited our schools in America. She says London has none, public or\\n      private, to compare with those of the United States.\\n \\n      The next morning we went to hear Laura Curtis Bullard read her\\n      sketch of Mrs. Stanton, which is to go into Famous Women, the same\\n      book for which Mrs. Stanton is writing me up. In the afternoon we\\n      called on Miss Müller, who purchased a house and lives in it that\\n      she may be a householder, as is necessary to hold office. She too\\n      is a member of the school board. Miss Müller insisted that I should\\n      talk to the ladies there, about thirty of them, and so I did,\\n      sitting under the trees in her garden, where we had our tea. Thence\\n      we went to the women\\'s suffrage parlors and met some fifty or\\n      sixty, and then to the Albemarle Club of both ladies and gentlemen,\\n      the only one of the kind in London. Then came a meeting at the\\n      Somerville Club--all ladies. A paper was read on the topic,\\n      \"Sentiment is not founded on reason and is a hindrance to\\n      progress,\" and followed by a bright discussion, in which both\\n      Rachel and I were invited to take part. A pretty full afternoon and\\n      evening!\\n \\n      Wednesday morning I studied on my speech for the 25th under the\\n      auspices of the National Women\\'s Suffrage Society. Harriot has so\\n      divided the subject, that Mrs. Stanton is to take the educational,\\n      social and religious departments, and S. B. A. the industrial,\\n      legal and political. That evening we went to the Court Theater with\\n      Mrs. Florence Fenwick Miller, another member of the London school\\n      board. The nights are all days here now--daylight till after 9\\n      o\\'clock and again at 3. Rachel and I lunched with Mr. and Mrs.\\n      Jacob Bright, and had a splendid visit; then went to the school\\n      board meeting.\\n \\n [Illustration: Priscilla Bright McLaren (Signed: \"Your loving friend\\n Priscilla Bright McLaren.\")]\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Cordially yours, Helen Taylor\"]\\n \\n      Saw there five of the seven women members, among them Miss Helen\\n      Taylor, stepdaughter of John Stuart Mill, and the senior woman\\n      member of the board. Today I spent an hour with Mrs. Lucas, sister\\n      of John and Jacob Bright, and this afternoon Rachel and I are going\\n      to a Women\\'s Poor Law Guardian meeting, at which Mrs. Lucas is to\\n      preside and other ladies to speak....\\n \\n      Just back from the meeting. In all England there are thirty-one\\n      women poor law guardians. There are 19,000 of the guardians elected\\n      and 1,000, mainly clergymen, are honorary. They have over 1,000,000\\n      paupers to look after. The secretary, Mrs. Chamberlain, stated that\\n      in her section of London there were 16,000. The guardians overlook\\n      everything about the workhouses and asylums, get no pay, and yet\\n      the public hesitates to put women on the board. One man stirred up\\n      the handful present by saying, \"suffrage not only for widows and\\n      spinsters, but for married women.\"\\n \\n      June 26.--Well, the ordeal is over and everybody is delighted.\\n      Moncure D. Conway said: \"I have learned more of American history\\n      from your speech than I ever dreamed had been made during the past\\n      thirty years.\" Even the timid ones expressed great satisfaction.\\n      Mrs. Stanton gave them the rankest radical sentiments, but all so\\n      cushioned they didn\\'t hurt. Mrs. Duncan McLaren came down from\\n      Edinburgh and Mrs. Margaret Parker from Dundee. Rachel said I made\\n      a good statement of the industrial, legal and political status of\\n      women in America. We went to tea with Mrs. Jacob Bright; then I\\n      took dinner with Mrs. Stanton at Mrs. Mellen\\'s, getting up from\\n      table at 9:15 P. M.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Most sincerely yours, Jane Cobden\"]\\n \\n      Saturday Rachel and I drove four hours in Miss Müller\\'s carriage\\n      and called on Lady Wilde, a bright, quaint woman. Sunday morning I\\n      went to Friends\\' meeting and had a look at John Bright, though I\\n      was not sure it was he until after the meeting was over; then he\\n      was gone, and I not introduced to him! In the afternoon I called on\\n      Miss Jane Cobden, daughter of Richard Cobden, a charming woman.\\n      Yesterday I presented her with a set of our History in memory of\\n      her noble father, and for her own sake also. I will not foreshadow\\n      the coming days but they are busy indeed. You will see that the\\n      Central Committee have put both my name and Mrs. Stanton\\'s on the\\n      card for the meeting of July 5....\\n \\n \\n                                                   LONDON, June 28.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: It is now just after luncheon and at 4 o\\'clock we\\n      are to be at Mrs. Jacob Bright\\'s reception, tomorrow evening at one\\n      at Mrs. Thomasson\\'s, which she gives to friends for the special\\n      purpose of meeting Stanton and Anthony, and Saturday at Frances\\n      Power Cobbe\\'s--and so we go. Yesterday morning Miss Frances Lord--a\\n      poor law guardian--escorted us through Lambeth workhouse. It has\\n      1,000 inmates and 700 more in the infirmary, and gives out-door\\n      relief to 2,000 besides.\\n \\n [Jacob Bright presided over the Prince\\'s Hall meeting, and William\\n Woodall over that at St. James\\' Hall.[17] All of the prominent\\n newspapers in Great Britain contained editorials on the meetings, and\\n noted especially the addresses of Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton,\\n speaking of them in a dignified and respectful manner.]\\n \\n \\n                                                   LONDON, July 13.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: My last letter was mailed the 3d. That afternoon I\\n      was at Rebecca Moore\\'s reception. We dined at Miss Müller\\'s and\\n      afterwards went to Horn\\'s assembly rooms to a suffrage meeting. Her\\n      sister Eva, wife of Walter McLaren, M.P., was one of the\\n      speakers.... At 9 P. M., we went to a Fourth of July reception at\\n      Mrs. Mellen\\'s, given in honor of Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony, and\\n      a brilliant affair it was. About 150 were there; she had elegant\\n      refreshments; and the young American girls gave songs, recitations,\\n      violin music, etc. Grace Greenwood recited her \"Mistress\\n      O\\'Rafferty\"--a woman\\'s rights poem in Irish brogue--very rich and\\n      racy; her daughter Annie sang, also Mrs. Carpenter, of Chicago;\\n      Kate Hillard, of Brooklyn, Adelaide Detchon, the actress, and\\n      Mildred Conway recited; Frank Lincoln impersonated; Nathaniel\\n      Mellen sang a negro jubilee melody; Maude Powell played the violin.\\n      She is not fifteen yet and is a charming player. The company did\\n      not disperse until after one.\\n \\n      July 5, drove to Mrs. Mellen\\'s to a 10 o\\'clock breakfast, and\\n      worked on Rachel\\'s report of my Prince\\'s Hall speech--you\\'ll find\\n      it in full in the Englishwoman\\'s Review. In the evening Mrs.\\n      Thomasson gave a splendid dinner-party, and afterwards took us all\\n      in carriages to the St. James\\' Hall suffrage demonstration, where\\n      there was a fine audience of about 2,000.... Next morning I went to\\n      a meeting of the suffrage friends from various towns who had come\\n      up for the demonstration. At 8 P. M. Mrs. McLaren took me to the\\n      House of Commons, to witness Mr. Hugh Mason present the Women\\'s\\n      Suffrage Bill; so I heard all the speeches pro and con, up to 1:30\\n      A. M., and how tired I was! Mr. Jacob Bright\\'s was the strongest\\n      and most earnest.\\n \\n      The morning of July 7, at the suffrage rooms, I heard strong\\n      protests against the way Mr. Mason disclaimed all intention of\\n      enfranchising married women. He carried the matter too far even for\\n      the most timid. In the afternoon, we went to the Somerville Club,\\n      and Rachel spoke beautifully on the need of union and co-operation\\n      among women. I followed her, and Mrs. McLaren moved a vote of\\n      thanks.... Rachel left for Antwerp this evening, to meet her mother\\n      and sister, and I returned to my room, lonesome enough. Sunday I\\n      lunched with Mrs. Lucas and Mrs. McLaren. I had calls from three\\n      factory-women, who told a sad story of the impossibility of getting\\n      even a dollar ahead by the most frugal and temperate habits.\\n \\n      Have I told you that I have a new dark garnet velvet? I wore it\\n      with my point lace at Mrs. Mellen\\'s reception on the Fourth, and\\n      the India shawl I have worn today for the first time.... Tuesday I\\n      went with Mrs. Lucas to the Crystal Palace at Sydenham to a great\\n      national temperance demonstration. More than 50,000 people passed\\n      the gates at a shilling apiece, and we saw a solid mass of 5,000\\n      boys and girls from all parts of the kingdom seated in a huge\\n      amphitheater, singing temperance songs--a beautiful sight. Then in\\n      another part of the palace was an audience of 2,000 listening to\\n      speeches. Among the speakers was Canon Wilberforce, a grandson of\\n      the great Abolitionist but a degenerate one. He said the reason the\\n      temperance movement was now progressing so rapidly was because the\\n      persons who led it were praying people, and that the Lord had\\n      willed it, and all depended on whether it was kept in the Lord\\'s\\n      hands--if not, then it would fall back like the old Washingtonian\\n      movement in America. Mrs. Lucas was very wroth, and so was I. He\\n      never spoke of woman except as \"maiden aunt\" or \"old grandmother,\"\\n      and advised the boys to take a little wine for the stomach\\'s sake.\\n \\n      At 6 o\\'clock we went to Miss Müller\\'s where I remained until today.\\n      She took me to the Gaiety Theater to see Sarah Bernhardt. What a\\n      magnificent actor! I never saw any man or woman who so absolutely\\n      buried self out of sight and became the very being personated.\\n      Though I couldn\\'t understand a single word, I enjoyed it all until\\n      the curtain fell at half-past eleven. I was tired beyond telling,\\n      but felt richly repaid by the seeing. She must be master of her\\n      divine art thus to impress one by action alone. Today Mrs. McLaren\\n      invites me to dine at her son\\'s, Charles McLaren, M.P. All this is\\n      written in a hurry but is perhaps better than nothing. It is so\\n      difficult to clutch a moment to write.\\n \\n \\n                                                   LONDON, July 19.\\n \\n      MY DEAR RACHEL: ... I am to attend a suffrage meeting at the\\n      Westminster Palace Hotel Hall this afternoon, and tomorrow at 10:25\\n      A. M. I start for Edinburgh with Mrs. Moore. I am bound to suck all\\n      the honey possible out of everybody and everything as they come to\\n      me or I go to them. It is such unwisdom, such unhappiness, not to\\n      look for and think and talk of the best in all things and all\\n      people; so you see at threescore and three I am still trying always\\n      to keep the bright and right side up. I am expecting a great\\n      ferment at the meeting today, for those who agree with Mrs. Jacob\\n      Bright have asked Mrs. Stanton to confer with them about what they\\n      shall do now. She advises them to demand suffrage for all women,\\n      married and single; but I contend that it is not in good taste for\\n      either of us to counsel public opposition to the bill before\\n      Parliament....\\n \\n      I wrote you about Miss ----. She is settled in the conviction that\\n      she never will marry any man--not even the one with whom she has\\n      had so close a friendship for the past ten years. She feels that to\\n      do the work for the world which she has mapped out she must eschew\\n      marriage, accepting platonic friendship but no more. I tell her she\\n      is giving her nature a severe trial by allowing herself this one\\n      particular friend, that if he does not in the end succeed in\\n      getting her to marry him, it will be the first escape I ever have\\n      heard of. She is a charming, earnest, conscientious woman, and I\\n      feel deeply interested in her experiment.\\n \\n [After being royally entertained in London and making many little trips\\n into the beautiful country around, Miss Anthony left for Edinburgh July\\n 20, carrying with her many pleasant remembrances of friends.]\\n \\n \\n                                                   EDINBURGH, July 22.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: Here I am in Huntley Lodge, the delightful home of\\n      Mrs. Elizabeth Pease Nichol, whose name we so often used to see in\\n      the Liberator and the Anti-Slavery Standard, and of whom we used to\\n      hear from Mr. Phillips and others who had visited England. We had a\\n      most cordial welcome from Mrs. Nichol--a queenly woman.

We\\n      are going to a \"substantial tea\" with Dr. Agnes McLaren, daughter\\n      of Duncan McLaren. She is very bright--spent four years in France\\n      studying her profession--has a good practice, takes a house by\\n      herself, and invites to it her friends.

If it had been only for an hour, I should have looked\\n      back on that hour as one of great privilege. But even if we should\\n      not meet again, I have had a pleasure which seems almost like a\\n      dream to me, in having made the personal acquaintance of thyself\\n      and dear Mrs. Stanton....\\n \\n      That thou shouldst have been on the 1st of August with the\\n      Elizabeth Pease of those grand anti-slavery times, revived in me\\n      the thought I expressed in moving a vote of thanks to thee and Mrs.\\n      Cady Stanton for the noble addresses you gave at the Prince\\'s Hall\\n      Meeting in London; ... that you had been brought here to give us\\n      the hand of rejoicing fellowship; and that it gave me great faith\\n      to believe the God of Justice was leading us on, and had brought\\n      England and America together by your presence amongst us at this\\n      most critical and hopeful time of our agitation....\\n \\n      I have addressed thee in the dear singular person, because it\\n      seemed to me in harmony with the noble simplicity of thy character,\\n      and also more affectionate--just as I feel toward thee.

At my reception he\\n      had said he did not want to \"see refined, delicate women going down\\n      into the muddy pool of politics,\" and I asked him if he had ever\\n      thought that, since the only places which were too filthy for women\\n      were those where men alone went, perhaps they might be so from lack\\n      of women. At dinner Mrs. Nichol rallied him on the report that he\\n      had been converted, and he admitted that it was true; so as he was\\n      leaving I said, \"Then I am to reckon an Edinboro\\' professor among\\n      my converts?\" He seized my hand and kissed it, saying, \"I\\'ll seal\\n      it with a kiss.\" Don\\'t be alarmed--he is fully eighty years of age\\n      but blithe and frolicsome--sang and acted out a Scotch war-song in\\n      the real Gaelic.\\n \\n      On August 1 we saw 200 medical students capped--and not a woman\\n      among them, because the powers ruled that none should be admitted.\\n      That afternoon we called on Professor Masson, a great champion of\\n      co-education. We took tea with Mrs. Jane and Miss Eliza Wigham. The\\n      stepmother, now eighty-two, was Jane Smeale in 1840. In their house\\n      have visited Henry C. Wright, Parker Pillsbury, and of course Mr.\\n      Garrison. Mrs. Nichol went with us to Melrose by rail, from which\\n      we drove to Abbotsford....\\n \\n      Tuesday at 2 o\\'clock Miss Osgood and I landed at Stirling. At 4:30\\n      we reached Callander, where I found no trunk, and not a man of them\\n      could give a guess as to its whereabouts. They give you no check\\n      here, but just stick a patch on your trunk. I had expected not to\\n      find it at every stop, and now it was gone for sure; but the\\n      station-master was certain he could find it and forward it to me,\\n      so he wrote out its description and telegraphed in every direction.\\n      Meanwhile we went to a hotel for luncheon and there in the hall was\\n      my trunk! Nobody knew why or how it got there and all acknowledged\\n      our American check system superior. I was raging at their\\n      stupidity, and no system at all, but laughingly said, \"You ought to\\n      send this trunk free a thousand miles to pay for my big scold at\\n      you.\" The man good-naturedly replied, \"Where will you have it\\n      sent?\" I answered \"Oban,\" and he booked it.\\n \\n      At 6 o\\'clock we took the front seat with the driver on a great high\\n      stage which we mounted by a ladder--they call the stage the\\n      \"machine\"--and drove a few miles to the Trossachs Hotel, past Loch\\n      Achray and Loch Vennachar.... While the rain rested this noon I\\n      took a walk up the ravine and it seemed very like going up the\\n      mountain at Grandfather Anthony\\'s. Indeed, there is nothing here\\n      more beautiful than we have in America, only everything has some\\n      historic or poetic association....\\n \\n \\n           BRUNTSFIELD LODGE, WHITEHOUSE LOAN, EDINBURGH, August 23.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: Here am I, back in Edinboro\\' again, at Dr.\\n      Jex-Blake\\'s delightful home--at least one hundred and fifty years\\n      old, with an acre or more of garden all enclosed with a six-foot\\n      wall. Lodge means a walled-in house; loan means lane, and the\\n      street took its name from a white house which two hundred and fifty\\n      years ago stood in this road. Every day the doctor has taken me a\\n      long and beautiful ride in her basket-carriage, driving her own\\n      little pony, White Angel, or her hay horse, while her boy-groom\\n      rides in his perch behind. Today she drove me through Lord\\n      Rosebery\\'s park of thousands of acres. It is lovely as a native\\n      forest--the roads macadamized all through--and a palace-like\\n      residence set deep within....\\n \\n \\n                                                   AMBLESIDE, August 27.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: Last Thursday I left Edinburgh for Penrith, which\\n      has a fine view of the lake and the hills beyond. Next morning I\\n      took steamer at Pooley Bridge. The trip the whole length of the\\n      lake was beautiful, but can not compare with Lake George--indeed,\\n      nothing I have seen equals that--but the hills (mountains, they\\n      call them here), the water and the sky all were lovely. At\\n      Patterdale I had a cup of tea, with bread and butter and the\\n      veritable orange marmalade manufactured at Dundee. Thence I took a\\n      stage over Kirkstone Pass, and walked two miles up the hills to a\\n      small hotel with a signboard saying it is the highest inhabited\\n      house in England, 1,114 feet above the sea--not very much beside\\n      Denver\\'s 6,000 and others in Colorado 10,000 or 12,000. Arrived at\\n      Ambleside to find the hotel overflowing, so they sent me to a\\n      farmer\\'s house where I had a good bed, splendid milk and sweet\\n      butter. Saturday morning I went by coach to Coniston, then railway\\n      to Furness Abbey, a seven-hundred-year-old ruin of magnificent\\n      proportions. After four hours there, I took a train to Lakeside and\\n      then steamer up Lake Windermere back to Ambleside. The hotel still\\n      being full, \"the Boots,\" as they call the porter or runner, found\\n      me lodgings at a private house, where I am now. It is the tiniest\\n      little stone cottage, but they have a cow, so I am in clover. My\\n      breakfasts consist of a bit of ham, cured by the hostess, a boiled\\n      egg, white and graham bread with butter and currant jam, and a cup\\n      of tea.\\n \\n      Saturday evening I strolled out and entered the gate of Harriet\\n      Martineau\\'s home. On the terrace I met the present occupants, Mr.\\n      and Mrs. William Henry Hills. They invited me to call in the\\n      morning, when they would be happy to show me over the house. In\\n      naming the hour they said: \"We never go to church--we are Liberal\\n      Friends--_real_ Friends.\" At that I immediately felt at home with\\n      them. I called and spent two hours sitting and chatting in the\\n      drawing-room where Harriet Martineau received her many\\n      distinguished guests, and in the kitchen saw the very same table,\\n      chairs and range which were there when she died, and sitting on the\\n      doorsill was the same black-and-yellow cat, said to be fourteen\\n      years old now. The Hills invited me to 5 o\\'clock tea, which we took\\n      in the library, where Miss Martineau used to sit and study as well\\n      as entertain her guests at dinner. It seemed impossible to realize\\n      that I was actually in her house. It is not large and is covered\\n      with ivy, which grows most luxuriantly everywhere. It fronts on a\\n      large field, much lower than the knoll on which it stands, and fine\\n      hills stretch off beyond. The old gardener, who has been here more\\n      than thirty years, still lives in a little stone cottage just under\\n      the terrace.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours affectionately, H. Martineau.\"]\\n \\n      Mr. Hills is a great lover of America and its institutions. He is\\n      one of the very few I have met here who really love republicanism.\\n      Nearly every one clings to the caste and class principle, thinks\\n      the world can not exist if a portion of the people are not doomed\\n      to be servants, and that for the poor to have an ambition to rise\\n      and become something more than their parents makes them\\n      discontented. \"Yes,\" I answer, \"and that is just what I want them\\n      to be, because it is only through a wholesome discontent with\\n      things as they are, that we ever try to make them any better.\"...\\n \\n \\n                                                   DUBLIN, September 10.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: ... I stayed in Belfast some days, and visited the\\n      Giant\\'s Causeway with Miss Isabella Tod, amidst sunshine and\\n      drenching showers; still it was a splendid sight, fully equal to\\n      Fingal\\'s Cave. The day before, we went nearly one hundred miles\\n      into the country to a village where she spoke at a temperance\\n      meeting. Here we were guests of the Presbyterian minister--a cousin\\n      of Joseph Medill, of the Chicago Tribune--and a cordial greeting he\\n      and his bright wife gave me. They have three Presbyterian churches\\n      in that one little village. All welcomed the woman speaker most\\n      kindly, but not a person could be urged to vote down the whiskey\\n      shops, as these are licensed by a justice of the peace, appointed\\n      by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, who receives his appointment\\n      from the Queen of England!\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours most truly, Isabella M. S. Tod\"]\\n \\n      So all she could ask was that every one should become a total\\n      abstainer. I do not see how they can submit to be thus voiceless as\\n      to their own home regulations.\\n \\n      Saturday I took tea with Mrs. Haslam, a bright, lovely \"come-outer\"\\n      from the Friends. She had invited some twenty or thirty to be\\n      present at eight, and I spoke, they asking questions and I\\n      answering. Among them were a son of the Abolitionist Richard D.\\n      Webb, and ever so many nephews and nieces. Eliza Wigham\\'s brother\\n      Henry and his wife had come ten miles to be there.... This\\n      afternoon I am going to the common council meeting with Alfred\\n      Webb, who is a member and a strong Home Ruler. The question of\\n      electing their own tax collector is to be discussed.\\n \\n \\n                                                   CORK, September 16.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: ... Your heart would break if you were here to see\\n      the poverty and rags, and yet the people seem cheerful under it\\n      all. Something surely must be wrong at the root to bear such fruit.\\n      I have had an awfully \"hard side of a board time\" of ten hours in a\\n      third-class car, paying therefor just as much as I would on the N.\\n      Y. Central for a first-class ticket. I not only saved $4.25 by\\n      going third-class, but I saw the natives. Men, women, boys and\\n      girls who had been to the market towns with their produce were on\\n      the train, and to see them as they tumbled in toward evening, at\\n      town after town, one would think that whiskey and tobacco were the\\n      main articles they bought. Any number of men and boys, and at least\\n      four women, were drunk enough, and they brought bottles with them\\n      and added to their puling idiocy as they went on. Nothing short of\\n      a pig-sty could match the filth, but it is only in that class of\\n      cars that you see anything of the vast number of poor farmers and\\n      laborers. If they can not pay exorbitant rates, refined, educated\\n      men and women are thrust into pens and seated face to face with the\\n      smoking, drinking, carousing rabble. I have everywhere protested\\n      against this outrage and urged the women to demand that the railway\\n      companies should give them separate cars, with no smoking\\n      allowed....\\n \\n \\n                                                   LEAMINGTON, October 1.\\n \\n      MY DEAR RACHEL: ... I must have told you of my good times at\\n      Belfast with Miss Tod, who gave a reception for me and I had a\\n      welcome all round.\\n \\n      Miss Osgood met me at Cork, and we went by rail to Macroom. Tuesday\\n      morning we visited the convent, nuns\\' schools, and the poorhouse\\n      with 400 helpless mortals, old and young; then took an Irish\\n      jaunting-car, and were driven some forty miles through \"the Gap\" to\\n      Glengariff. It rained almost all the way, much to our disgust. Next\\n      morning we packed into two great stages with thirty or more others,\\n      and started for the lakes of Killarney; but soon the rain poured\\n      again, and as we were losing so much of the scenery we stopped\\n      half-way at Kenmare. We visited the convent and the Mother Abbess\\n      showed us every cranny. Thirty girls were at work on beautiful\\n      Irish point and Limerick lace. These nuns have 400 pupils, and give\\n      200 of the poorest their breakfast and lunch--porridge and a bit of\\n      bread. At two we took stage again, the sky looked promising, but\\n      alas! for half an hour it fairly poured. Then it grew lighter, and\\n      we got very fine views of hills and dales. Killarney _is_\\n      lovely....\\n \\n      Saturday I sauntered along the streets of Killarney, passed the\\n      market, and saw all sorts of poor humanity coming in with their\\n      cattle to sell or to buy. Many rode in two-wheeled carts without\\n      seat or spring, drawn by little donkeys, and nearly all the women\\n      and girls were bareheaded and barefooted. On the bridge I saw some\\n      boys looking down. I looked too and there was a spectacle--a\\n      ragged, bareheaded, barefooted woman tossing a wee baby over her\\n      shoulders and trying to get her apron switched around to hold it\\n      fast on her back. I heard her say to herself, \"I\\'ll niver do it,\"\\n      so I said, \"Boys, one of you run down there and help her.\" At that\\n      instant she succeeded in getting the baby adjusted, and to my\\n      horror took up a bundle from the grass and disclosed a second baby!\\n      Then _I_ went down. I learned that she had just come from the\\n      poorhouse, where she had spent six weeks, and before going further\\n      had laid her two three-weeks-old boys on the cold, wet grass, while\\n      she washed out their clothes in the stream. The clothing was the\\n      merest rags, all scrambled up in a damp bundle. She had heard her\\n      old mother was ill in Milltown and had \"fretted\" about her till she\\n      could bear it no longer, so had started to walk ten miles to her. I\\n      hailed a boy with a jaunting-car--told her to wait and I would take\\n      her home--got my luncheon--fed the boy\\'s horse, bought lunch for\\n      boy and woman--and off we went, she sitting on one side of the car\\n      with her two babies, wet bundle, two milk bottles and rubber\\n      appendages, bare feet and flying hair, and I on the other, with the\\n      boy in front.\\n \\n      For a long way both babies cried; they were blue as pigeons, and\\n      had on nothing but little calico slips, no socks even. She had four\\n      children older than these--a husband who went to fairs selling\\n      papers and anything he could to support them all--and an aged\\n      father and mother who lived with them. She said if God had given\\n      her only one child, she could still help earn something to live on,\\n      but now He had given her two, she couldn\\'t. When we reached\\n      Milltown I followed her home. It was in a long row of one-room\\n      things with a door--but no window. Some peat was smouldering under\\n      a hole in the roof called a chimney, and the place was thick with\\n      smoke. On the floor in one corner was some straw with a blanket on\\n      it, which she said was her bed; in another were some boards\\n      fastened into bed-shape, with straw packed in, and this belonged to\\n      her father and mother. Where the four other children, with the\\n      chickens and the pig, found their places to sleep, I couldn\\'t see.\\n      I went to the home of another tenant, and there again was one room,\\n      and sitting around a pile of smoking-hot potatoes on the cold, wet\\n      ground--not a board or even a flag-stone for a floor--were six\\n      ragged, dirty children. Not a knife, fork, spoon or platter was to\\n      be seen. The man was out working for a farmer, his wife said, and\\n      the evidences were that \"God\" was about to add a No. 7 to her\\n      flock. What a dreadful creature their God must be to keep sending\\n      hungry mouths while he withholds the bread to fill them!...\\n \\n      I went back to Killarney heart-sick; wrote letters Sunday, and\\n      Monday took train for Limerick, where I rushed round for an hour or\\n      two.... Then went on to Galway. Tuesday morning took the mail-car\\n      to Connemara, and had company all the way--a judge, an Irish M.P.,\\n      and two Dublin drummers--with whom I talked over the Irish problem.\\n      I had meant to make the tour of the western coast up to\\n      Londonderry, but my courage failed. It was to be the same\\n      soul-sickening sight all the way--only, I was assured, worse than\\n      anything yet seen. I took the stage back to Galway, every one\\n      saying it was sure to be a fine day, but it proved to be terrific\\n      wind and rain, and before I had gone ten miles my seat was a pool\\n      of water and it took all my skill to keep my umbrella right side\\n      out.... Once while the driver changed horses I stood in front of a\\n      big fire on the hearth of the best farmer\\'s house I have seen here.\\n      Everything was clean and cheerful--two rooms--a bed made up with a\\n      spotless white spread--the old father smoking and the wife cooking\\n      dinner. She lifted a wooden cover from a jar and proudly showed me\\n      her butter--patted down with her hands, I could see--and near by\\n      was another jar with milk. Think of butter being made in a room\\n      full of tobacco-smoke! Then I went my last ten out of the fifty\\n      miles, having been soaking wet for eight hours. At my hotel I had\\n      room and fire on a \"double-quick,\" bath-tub and hot water, and put\\n      myself through a regular grooming. In the morning I rode around\\n      Galway, saw Queen\\'s College and the bay, and then took train for\\n      Belfast.\\n \\n From the diary:\\n \\n      Sept. 11.--In Dublin. The Professor of Arabic took me through\\n      Trinity College, with its library of 200,000 volumes. Thence to the\\n      old Parliament House, now the Bank of Ireland. In the afternoon\\n      Alfred Webb went with me to the National League rooms and from\\n      there to Thomas Webb\\'s for tea, where I saw the names of Garrison\\n      and N. P. Rogers written in 1840. We called on Michael Davitt, the\\n      leader of the Irish Land League, who impressed me as an earnest,\\n      honest man, deeply-rooted in the principles of freedom and\\n      equality, and claiming all for woman that he does for man.\\n \\n      Sept. 16.--At Youghal. Visited the home of Sir Walter Raleigh, Lady\\n      Hennessy, eighty years old, showing me around. Found in a library\\n      Children of the Abbey, and read again the story of Lord Mortimer\\n      and Amanda. Once it thrilled my young soul, but now it seems\\n      inexpressibly thin.\\n \\n      Sept. 20.--While I was talking in the car today with an Irishwoman\\n      about the poverty here, another behind me shouted: \"It is very ill\\n      manners for an American to come over here and abuse the English\\n      government.\"\\n \\n      Sept. 29.--In Belfast. O, how I would like to purchase _all_ the\\n      linen I want for myself and my friends! Have bought as much as I\\n      dared and after all perhaps I\\'m cheated--but it\\'s done, so I won\\'t\\n      worry.\\n \\n      Sept. 30.--Landed at Fleetwood and went direct to Rugby. Walked all\\n      around the famous school, but had not courage to go in and\\n      introduce myself to Doctor Jex-Blake, whose sister\\'s guest I had so\\n      recently been.\\n \\n      Oct. 1.--At Leamington. Went direct to Kenilworth Castle, a grand\\n      old ruin; the home of Leicester, where Queen Elizabeth visited him\\n      in the olden days.\\n \\n      Oct. 2.--Mrs. Mullinor called at our hotel and accompanied us to\\n      Warwick Castle, a splendid pile. We lunched with her, and when Mr.\\n      M. put fork into the roast he remarked: \"Wife asked me what she\\n      should order for dinner and I said, \\'a leg of mutton, for Americans\\n      never see such a thing at home.\\'\" We smiled and ate it with a\\n      relish.\\n \\n      Oct. 3.--At Stratford on Avon, and we have visited every spot\\n      sacred to the memory of Shakespeare, and walked through the meadows\\n      and down by the riverside....\\n \\n      Oct. 4.--In Oxford. I have visited many of the colleges, and as I\\n      saw where all the millions of dollars had been expended for the\\n      education of boys alone, I groaned in spirit and betook me to\\n      Somerville and St. Margaret\\'s Halls, where at least there is a\\n      shelter for girls, and a beginning.\\n \\n      Oct. 5.--In London; and how almost like getting home it seems to\\n      come back here.\\n \\n \\n                                                   LONDON, October 7.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: Mrs. Stanton feels that she must stay with Hattie\\n      till the baby is a month old, and then have a week for farewell\\n      visits in London. Cousins Fannie and Charles Dickinson are here.\\n      Today I learned that I should have a chance to see and hear John\\n      Bright at a convention of the Liberal Party at Leeds, October 17;\\n      all these together have made me put off leaving a little longer.\\n      Since yesterday we have been in the midst of a genuine London fog.\\n      It is now 10 A. M. and even darker than it was two hours ago, when\\n      we dressed and breakfasted by gaslight. I saw smoky, foggy days\\n      here last March but they could not compare with this, and yet the\\n      people say, \"O, this is nothing to what November will bring.\"...\\n \\n \\n                                                   LONDON, October 27.\\n \\n      MY DEAR SISTER: Since I last wrote you I have visited Leeds where I\\n      was the guest of Mrs. Hannah Ford, who has an elegant home--Adel\\n      Grange. There were several other guests who had come to attend the\\n      great Liberal demonstration, among them Mrs. Margaret Priestman\\n      Tanner, a sister-in-law of John Bright, and his son Albert. Mrs.\\n      Alice Scatcherd, of Leeds, was the person who had the sagacity to\\n      get women sent as delegates and secure them admission on terms of\\n      perfect equality. The amendment was a great triumph. She invited\\n      the friends to meet next day at her house, where I saw John\\n      Bright\\'s daughter, Mrs. Helen Clark, and Richard Cobden\\'s, Miss\\n      Jane Cobden. Both made speeches at the convention, and most fitting\\n      it was they should--the daughters of the two leading Radicals of a\\n      half century ago.\\n \\n      On Saturday, Mrs. Ford took me to Haworth, the home of the Brontë\\n      sisters. It is a bleak enough place now, and must have been even\\n      more so forty or fifty years ago when those sensitive plants lived\\n      there. A most sad day it was to me, as I looked into the little\\n      parlor where the sisters walked up and down with their arms around\\n      each other and planned their novels, or sat before the fireplace\\n      and built air-castles. Then there were the mouldering tombstones of\\n      the graveyard which lies in front and at one side of the house, and\\n      the old church-pew, directly over the vault where lay their loved\\n      mother and two sisters. And later, when Emily and Anne and the\\n      erring brother Branwell had joined the others, poor Charlotte sat\\n      there alone. The pew had to be removed every time the vault was\\n      opened to receive another occupant. Think of those delicate women\\n      sitting in that fireless, mouldy church, listening to their old\\n      father\\'s dry, hard theology, with their feet on the cold,\\n      carpetless stones which covered their loved dead. It was too\\n      horrible! Then I walked over the single stone pathway through the\\n      fields toward the moor, opened the same wooden gates, and was, and\\n      still continue to be, dipped into the depths of their utter\\n      loneliness and sadness, born so out of time and place. How much the\\n      world of literature has lost because of their short and\\n      ill-environed lives, we can guess only from its increased wealth in\\n      spite of all their adverse conditions.\\n \\n      From Leeds I went to Birmingham to attend an Anti-Contagious\\n      Diseases Acts conference, and there heard the serene, lovely\\n      Josephine E. Butler.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Josephine E. Butler\"]\\n \\n      Miss Müller has invited Mrs. Stanton and me to spend the rest of\\n      our time with her.

Friday afternoon we receive at Miss Müller\\'s.\\n      Saturday morning I leave for Bristol to visit Miss Mary Estlin,\\n      Mrs. Tanner and the Misses Priestman, three sisters-in-law of John\\n      Bright, who give a reception in my honor. The 12th I visit Margaret\\n      E. Parker, at Warrington, and the next afternoon Mrs. Stanton and I\\n      both go to Alderley Edge, near Manchester, to the home of Mr. and\\n      Mrs. Jacob Bright.[18] On the 14th we attend the annual meeting of\\n      the Manchester Women\\'s Suffrage Association, and on the 16th go to\\n      Liverpool where a reception will be given us in the afternoon. That\\n      evening we shall spend at our hotel with the friends who go to see\\n      us off, and on the 17th we give ourselves to old ocean\\'s care in\\n      the Cunarder Servia.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Believe me, yours very truly, M. G.\\n Fawcett.\"]\\n \\n      Don\\'t worry now if you do not hear from me again until I touch\\n      Yankee soil; and don\\'t worry if the wind blows or if you learn the\\n      vessel is late or lost. If the Servia fail to land me safe and\\n      sound, don\\'t repine or stop because I am not, but buckle on a new\\n      and stronger harness and do double work for the good cause of\\n      woman. You have the best of judgment in our work and are capable of\\n      doing much if only you had confidence in yourself, so whatever\\n      comes to me, do you be all the more for the less that _I_ am.\\n \\n Half of Miss Anthony\\'s nine-months\\' trip abroad had been spent in Great\\n Britain. To her all the other attractions of the old world were as\\n nothing compared with its living, breathing humanity. On the continent\\n she was deprived of any exchange of thought with its people because she\\n spoke no language but her own, and this made her prefer England; but\\n there was another and a stronger interest--the great progressive\\n movement which was going forward in regard to woman. Here she found\\n women of fine intellect and high social position engaged in the same\\n work to which she had given more than thirty years of her own life; and\\n here she met sympathy and recognition which would have been impossible\\n in any other country in Europe. Her central thought in going to Great\\n Britain had been to secure the co-operation of Englishwomen in holding\\n an international suffrage convention. At first her proposition met with\\n no response. The most radical of English women were conservative\\n compared to those of America, but after they had become thoroughly\\n acquainted with Mrs. Stanton and herself and prejudice had been\\n supplanted by confidence, the idea began to be more favorably regarded.\\n One serious difficulty in the way of the proposed convention lay in the\\n fact that the suffrage women of England and Scotland were not themselves\\n in thorough unison as to plans and purposes. No definite action was\\n taken until the last afternoon of their stay, when, at the reception\\n given in their honor by Dr. Ewing Whittle, in Liverpool, with the hearty\\n concurrence of Mrs. McLaren, Mrs. Lucas, Mrs. Scatcherd and Mrs. Parker,\\n who had accompanied Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton to see them safely on\\n board their vessel, a strong committee was formed to promote\\n international organization.\\n \\n [Illustration: Margaret Bright Lucas (Signed: \"Yours affectionately\\n Margaret Bright Lucas\")]\\n \\n They sailed from Liverpool on the Servia, November 17, 1883. Among their\\n fellow voyagers were Mrs. Cornelia C. Hussey, of Orange, N. J., to whom\\n the cause of woman suffrage and Miss Anthony personally are deeply\\n indebted; and Mrs. Margaret B. Sullivan, of Chicago, the distinguished\\n editorial writer. There was some lovely weather, which was greatly\\n enjoyed, but heavy fogs impeded the ship and it was just ten days from\\n the time of starting when, on November 27, they steamed into New York\\n harbor and stepped again on the shores of loved America.\\n \\n FOOTNOTES:\\n \\n [14] The many inquiries and directions in regard to the suffrage work,\\n and the loving messages to friends and relatives at home, are omitted in\\n the extracts made from Miss Anthony\\'s letters; but they are of constant\\n occurrence, and show that these were never absent from her thoughts.\\n \\n [15] While in Florence, Miss Anthony was entertained by the Countess de\\n Resse, daughter of Elizabeth B. Phelps, of New York, and by the Princess\\n Koltzoff-Massalsky, the distinguished author and artist, known through\\n Europe by her pen-name of Dora d\\'Istria.\\n \\n [16] Miss Anthony occupied some rainy days, while here, in wrapping up\\n papers and writing letters which she put in her official envelopes,\\n bearing the revolutionary mottoes, \"No just government can be formed\\n without the consent of the governed,\" \"Taxation without representation\\n is tyranny.\" After a few days a dignified official appeared at the\\n American legation with a large package of mail bearing the proscribed\\n mottoes, and said, \"Such sentiments can not pass through the post-office\\n in Germany.\" So in modest, uncomplaining wraps the letters and papers\\n started again for the land of the free.--E.

Body of\\n the Hall and Gallery Free.\\n \\n [18] A pleasant letter was received afterwards from Mrs. Bright, in\\n which she made this playful reference to Miss Anthony\\'s always\\n depreciating herself in favor of Mrs. Stanton:\\n \\n \"We have thought of you often and hoped that the wind, which has been\\n rough here, has been tempered on the Atlantic for your sakes. Apropos of\\n the very beautiful allusion you made to Mrs. Cady Stanton\\'s popularity\\n and the effect produced by her personal appearance, I must tell you of a\\n remark made by my little son John immediately after your departure. I\\n found him sitting on the sofa in my bedroom, thinking deeply. \\'Mamma,\\'\\n he said, \\'I wish you could get me a photograph of Miss Anthony. I think\\n she has such a fine face. There is something about it so firm and yet so\\n kind.\\' I said, \\'Do you like her better than Mrs. Stanton?\\' \\'Oh dear,\\n yes, much better,\\' replied Johnnie. So you see she does not monopolize\\n all the admiration!\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER XXXIII.\\n \\n CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS--VISIT TO NEW ORLEANS.\\n \\n 1884-1885.\\n \\n \\n Most of the newspapers had a welcome for Miss Anthony. In a two-column\\n report in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle she is quoted as saying:\\n \\n      \"I can scarcely tell you of the hospitality extended, the dinners,\\n      teas and receptions given in our honor. I had no idea we were so\\n      well-known in Great Britain or that there was such cordial feeling\\n      toward us. Of course, I met chiefly those known as Liberals and the\\n      sympathizers with our cause. Public sentiment there is rapidly\\n      growing in our favor. In the discussion I heard in Parliament not a\\n      Conservative uttered a word against the suffrage already possessed\\n      by women but relied upon the hackneyed argument that when married\\n      women were included there would be trouble.\"\\n \\n      \"You saw the Queen, I suppose?\"\\n \\n      \"No; I thought more of seeing the Bright family than the Queen and\\n      I never happened to be near where she was. I really had very little\\n      leisure to look around. I am ashamed to say I did not visit\\n      Westminster until the morning before I came away, but it was simply\\n      for lack of time. The social idea was of more importance to me.\"\\n \\n The New York Evening Telegram said editorially: \"The statement of Miss\\n Susan B. Anthony, in another column, illustrates the superb\\n determination of that champion of woman\\'s political rights. In the\\n struggle which has constituted her life-work she has the rare advantage\\n of not being able to comprehend defeat. Battling under the inspiration\\n of an enthusiast--of a fanatic, some may be disposed to say--she knows\\n no such word as fail. The most disheartening reverses appear to her\\n inspired imagination but steps in an undeviating march of progress. It\\n was enthusiasm such as this that made the career of Joan of Arc.\\n Without it, not even the broad intellect and strong soul of Miss Anthony\\n could sustain the burden of the struggle which she is called upon to\\n lead.\" The Washington correspondent of the Cleveland Leader thus began a\\n long interview:\\n \\n      Susan B. Anthony is back from Europe, and is here for the winter\\'s\\n      fight in behalf of woman suffrage. She seems remarkably well, and\\n      has gained fifteen pounds since she left last spring. She is\\n      sixty-three, but looks just the same as twenty years ago. There is\\n      perhaps an extra wrinkle in her face, a little more silver in her\\n      hair, but her blue eyes are just as bright, her mouth as serious\\n      and her step as active as when she was forty. She would attract\\n      attention in any crowd. She is of medium height and medium form but\\n      her face is wonderfully intellectual, and she moves about like the\\n      woman of a purpose that she is. She says she experiences far\\n      different treatment by public men now from what she did years ago.\\n      The statesman of the past always came to her with a smirk on his\\n      face as though he considered woman\\'s rights nonsensical and thought\\n      himself wonderfully condescending to take notice of her at all.\\n      \"Now,\" says she, \"public men look upon our mission as a matter of\\n      business, and we are considered from that standpoint.\"\\n \\n The interview closed:\\n \\n      \"One question more, Miss Anthony. Will you please tell me what is\\n      your highest ideal of the woman of the future?\"\\n \\n      \"It is hard to say,\" was the reply. \"The woman of the future will\\n      far surpass the one of the present, even as the man of the future\\n      will surpass the one of today. The ages are progressive, and I look\\n      for a far higher manhood and womanhood than we now have. I think\\n      this will come through making the sexes co-equal. When women\\n      associate with men in serious matters, as they do now in frivolous,\\n      both will grow stronger and the world\\'s work will be better done. I\\n      look for the day when the woman who has a political or judicial\\n      brain will have as much right to sit in the Senate or on the\\n      Supreme Bench as men have; when women will have equal property,\\n      business and political rights with men; when the only criterion of\\n      excellence or position shall be the ability and character of the\\n      individual; and this time will come. All of the Western colleges\\n      are now open to women, and send forth more than 2,000 women\\n      graduates every year. Think of the effect upon the race to come!\\n      The woman of the future will be a better wife, mother and citizen\\n      than the woman of today.\"\\n \\n There were, however, some discordant notes in the symphony of pleasant\\n things which by 1883 had become customary in the newspapers. For\\n instance, the Cincinnati Times-Star headed its interview: \"Susan\\n Speaks--Miss Anthony Corralled by a Times-Star Correspondent--The Old\\n Lady Wears Good Clothes and Stops at First-class Hotels--Bubbling about\\n the Ballot.\" The smart reporter described the size of her foot, devoted\\n a paragraph to the question whether her teeth were natural or\\n artificial, and said: \"There must be money in being a reformer, for Miss\\n Anthony lives at the Riggs House in good style, and expects to be there\\n all winter, and this, after a summer in Europe, would be a pretty severe\\n drain on any but a long purse.\" When one thinks of Miss Anthony\\'s\\n uniform kindness and courtesy to reporters, always granting an interview\\n no matter how tired or how busy she might be, and assisting them in\\n every possible way with information and suggestions, it is astonishing\\n that any one of them could indulge in petty, personal criticism and\\n innuendoes.\\n \\n Miss Anthony had now another friend at court, Col. Halbert S. Greenleaf,\\n of Rochester, having been elected to Congress. Both he and his wife were\\n strong and influential advocates of suffrage, and her warm personal\\n friends. The diary shows that every day of December she was conferring\\n with officials and their wives who were friendly to the cause, making\\n converts wherever possible and co-operating actively with the District\\n committee in all the drudgery of detail necessary to a successful\\n convention. It is only by reading her diary that one can understand what\\n a mental agony it was for Miss Anthony to press this matter upon\\n congressmen, year after year, to be repulsed by those who were opposed\\n and only tolerated by those in favor, who had many other matters on hand\\n which to them seemed of much greater importance. \"Oh, if men only could\\n know how hard it is for women to be forever snubbed when they attempt to\\n plead for their rights! It is perfectly disheartening that no member\\n feels any especial interest or earnest determination in pushing this\\n question of woman suffrage, to all men only a side issue,\" she writes in\\n this little confidant; but not even in her letters is there ever a note\\n of discouragement. To the world at large and to those who were\\n associated with her, she was always brave, bright and hopeful. It causes\\n a keen heartache to reflect upon how she crucified herself for fifty\\n years, unfaltering and uncomplaining, in order to make conditions better\\n for womankind. To Hon. William D. Kelley, of Pennsylvania, who believed\\n in woman suffrage and voted for it, but did not feel enough interest to\\n push the matter in Congress, she wrote, January 6, 1884:\\n \\n      No one shrinks more from making herself obnoxious than I do, and\\n      but for the sake of all women, your darling Florence included, I\\n      should never again say a word to you on the subject of using your\\n      influence to secure the passage of a Sixteenth Amendment\\n      proposition. Last winter you put off my appeal for help with, \"This\\n      is the short session and the tariff question is of momentous\\n      importance.\" Now, since this is the \"long session,\" will you not\\n      take hold of this work, and with the same earnestness that you do\\n      other questions?\\n \\n      It is cruel for you to leave your daughter, so full of hope and\\n      resolve, to suffer the humiliations of disfranchisement she already\\n      feels so keenly, and which she will find more and more galling as\\n      she grows into the stronger and grander woman she is sure to be. If\\n      it were your son who for any cause was denied his right to have his\\n      opinion counted, you would compass sea and land to lift the ban\\n      from him. And yet the crime of denial in his case would be no\\n      greater than in that of your daughter. It is only because men are\\n      so accustomed to the ignoring of woman\\'s opinions, that they do not\\n      believe women suffer from the injustice as would men; precisely as\\n      people used to scout the idea that negroes, whose parents before\\n      them always had been enslaved, suffered from that cruel bondage as\\n      white men would.\\n \\n      Now, will you not set about in good earnest to secure the\\n      enfranchisement of woman? Why do not the Republicans push this\\n      question? The vote on Keifer\\'s resolution showed almost a party\\n      line. Of the 124 nays, only 4 were Republicans; while of the 85\\n      yeas, only 13 were Democrats. Even should you fail to get another\\n      committee, the discussion and the vote would array the members and\\n      set each man and party in their true places to be seen of all men,\\n      and all women too.\\n \\n The term of the select committee on woman suffrage having expired with\\n the close of the Forty-seventh Congress, a new one was appointed by the\\n Senate of the Forty-eighth. The House committee on rules refused to\\n report such a committee but placed the question in the hands of\\n Representative Warren Keifer, of Ohio, who made a gallant fight for it\\n on the floor, during which he said: \"Is not the right of petition a\\n constitutional right? Has not woman, in this country at least, risen\\n above the rim and horizon of servitude, discredit and disgrace, and has\\n she not a right, representing as she does in many instances great\\n questions of property, to present her appeals to this national council\\n and have them wisely and judiciously considered? I think it is due to\\n our wives, daughters, mothers and sisters to afford them an avenue\\n through which they can legitimately and judicially reach the ear of this\\n great nation.\"\\n \\n He was ably assisted by Mr. Belford, of Colorado. The measure to appoint\\n this committee was bitterly opposed by Mr. Reagan, of Texas, who said in\\n a long speech: \"When woman so far misunderstands her duty as to want to\\n go to working on the roads and making rails and serving in the militia\\n and going into the army, I want to protect her against it.\" The vote\\n resulted--yeas, 85, nays, 124; absent or not voting, 112.\\n \\n Immediately after the return of members from the holiday recess, Miss\\n Anthony wrote to each of the 112 asking how he would vote if the\\n question came up again. To these letters 52 replies were received, 26\\n from Republicans, all of whom would vote yes; 26 from Democrats, 10 of\\n whom would vote yes, 10, no; while 6 did not know how they would vote.\\n As these 36 affirmative votes added to the 85 yeas would so nearly have\\n overcome the adverse majority, John D. White, of Kentucky, at the\\n solicitation of Miss Anthony, made another earnest effort in February to\\n secure the desired committee, but the Democrats refused to allow the\\n question to come to a vote. She was greatly disappointed at the failure\\n to get the select committee, but afterwards became of the opinion that\\n it was more advantageous to return to the old plan of working through\\n the judiciary committee.\\n \\n Miss Anthony had to be continually on the alert to head off zealous but\\n injudicious women who were determined to commit the suffrage movement to\\n the various ologies and isms of the day, and especially to personal\\n matters. Even a woman so intellectually great as Mrs. Stanton could not\\n be relied upon always to make her individual opinions subserve what was\\n demanded of her position as president of the National Association. In\\n January Miss Anthony received a document which Mrs. Stanton had prepared\\n as an \"open letter,\" to be signed by both of them officially and given\\n to the press, congratulating Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to a\\n white woman and sympathizing with him because of the adverse criticism\\n it had called out! She especially urged that he be given a prominent\\n place on the program at the approaching convention. Miss Anthony replied\\n at once:\\n \\n      I do hope you won\\'t put your foot into the question of\\n      intermarriage of the races. It has no place on our platform, any\\n      more than the question of no marriage at all, or of polygamy, and,\\n      so far as I can prevent it, shall not be brought there. I beg you\\n      therefore not to congratulate him publicly. Were there a\\n      proposition to punish the woman and leave the man to go scot free,\\n      then we should have a protest to make against the invidious\\n      discrimination.\\n \\n      The question of the amalgamation of the different races is a\\n      scientific one, affecting women and men alike. I do not propose to\\n      have it discussed on our platform. Our intention at this convention\\n      is to make every one who hears or reads believe in the grand\\n      principle of equality of rights and chances for women, and if they\\n      see on our program the name of Douglass every thought will be\\n      turned toward the subject of amalgamation and away from that of\\n      woman and her disfranchised. Neither you nor I have the right thus\\n      to complicate or compromise our question, and if we take the bits\\n      in our teeth in one direction we must expect our compeers to do the\\n      same in others. You very well know that if you plunge in, as your\\n      letter proposes, your endorsement will be charged upon me and the\\n      whole association. Do not throw around that marriage the halo of a\\n      pure and lofty duty to break down race lines. Your sympathy has run\\n      away with your judgment. Lovingly and fearfully yours.\\n \\n It is hardly necessary to say that the \"open letter\" was not published.\\n \\n Everybody\\'s burdens were laid upon Miss Anthony\\'s shoulders. In looking\\n over the mass of correspondence it seems as if each writer wanted\\n something and looked to her to supply it. All expected her to take the\\n lead, to do the planning, to bear the responsibility, and usually she\\n was equal to the demand, but even her brave spirit could not resist an\\n occasional groan on the pages of the diary. When a new accession to the\\n ranks, from whom she expected great assistance, wrote, \"I do not know\\n how to plan but tell me what to do and I will obey,\" she says, \"My heart\\n sinks within me; so few seem to use their brain-power on ways and\\n means.\" And again: \"This drain of helpless women, able and willing to\\n work but utterly ignorant of how to do it, wears me out body and soul.\"\\n She was greatly distressed because so many of the younger women were\\n frequently incapacitated by illness, and writes: \"O, the weak-bodied\\n girls of the present generation, they make me heart-sick!\"\\n \\n But never did the women themselves know of these feelings. To the\\n younger ones she wrote: \"Don\\'t give up \\'beat\\' at any of those places\\n till I have dropped my plummet into them.... Your young shoulders will\\n have to learn to bear the crotchets of all sorts of people and not bend\\n or break under them.... Put all the blame on me; they may abuse me but\\n not you.... It makes my heart ache every minute to see you so tired....\\n Vent all your ill-feelings on me but keep sweet as June roses to\\n everybody else. It does not pay to lose your temper.... You will have to\\n learn to let people pile injustice on you and then trust to time to\\n right it all.\" If on rare occasions she spoke a word of censure, it was\\n followed by a letter in the next mail, full of sorrow and repentance.\\n She always signed herself, even in the darkest hours, \"Yours with love\\n and hope.\" Beautiful optimism, sublime courage!\\n \\n Sunday, February 3, 1884, Miss Anthony read in the morning papers of the\\n sudden death of Wendell Phillips. He had been to her always the one\\n being without a peer, the purest, sweetest, best of men. The news\\n overwhelmed her with grief and she wrote at once to Robert Purvis:\\n \\n      How cut down I am at the telegram, \"Wendell Phillips is dead,\" and\\n      I know you are equally so. I hope you can go on to Boston to the\\n      funeral, and help tenderly to lay away that most precious human\\n      clay. Who shall say the fitting word for Wendell Phillips at this\\n      last hour as lovingly and beautifully as he has done so many, many\\n      times for the grand men and women who have gone before him? There\\n      seem none left but you and Parker Pillsbury to pour out your souls\\'\\n      dearest love in his memory. Would that I had the tongue of an angel\\n      and could go and bear my testimony to the grandeur of that noblest\\n      of God\\'s works! I can think of no one who can rightly and fully\\n      estimate that glorious character. What a sad hour for his beloved\\n      wife! He said to me on my last visit: \"My one wish has come to be\\n      that I may live to bury Ann.\" He doubtless knew of his impending\\n      disease of the heart. On whose shoulders will fall the mantle of\\n      Wendell Phillips? When will the children of men ever listen to\\n      such a matchless voice? How poor the world seems! In sorrow I am\\n      with you.\\n \\n She could not stay away and, inclement as was the weather, went to\\n Boston three days later to look for the last time upon the loved face.\\n \\n At the request of many ladies in Washington the National Convention was\\n held in March, instead of earlier in the winter, to avoid the social\\n distractions which always precede the Lenten season. The ladies were\\n pleasantly received by President Arthur.[19] This was an exceptionally\\n brilliant convention, a noteworthy feature being the large number of\\n letters containing the greetings of the distinguished men and women of\\n Great Britain, whom Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton had met and interested\\n during their trip abroad. The following was read from Matthew Simpson,\\n senior bishop in the Methodist church, among his last public utterances,\\n as he died a few months later:\\n \\n      For more than thirty years I have been in favor of suffrage for\\n      woman. I was led to this position, not by the consideration of the\\n      question of natural rights or of alleged injustice or of inequality\\n      before the law, but by what I believed would be her influence on\\n      the great moral questions of the day. Were the ballot in the hands\\n      of women, I am satisfied that the evils of intemperance would be\\n      greatly lessened; and I fear, without that ballot, we shall not\\n      succeed against the saloons and kindred evils in large cities. You\\n      will doubtless have many obstacles placed in your way; there will\\n      be many conflicts to sustain; but I have no doubt that the coming\\n      years will see the triumph of your cause, and that our higher\\n      civilization and morality will rejoice in the work which\\n      enlightened women will accomplish.[20]\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"M. Simpson\"]\\n \\n Both Senate and House committees granted hearings, and eloquent\\n addresses were made by delegates from many States. Miss Anthony said in\\n part:\\n \\n      This is the fifteenth year we have appeared before Congress in\\n      person, and the nineteenth by petitions, asking national protection\\n      for women in the exercise of their right to vote. In the winter of\\n      1865 and 1866 we sent your honorable body a ten-thousand prayer,\\n      asking you not to put \"male\" in the second section of the proposed\\n      Fourteenth Amendment; and again we appealed to you by thousands of\\n      petitions that you would add \"sex\" after \"race or color\" in the\\n      Fifteenth, but all to no avail. Then by an eighty-thousand petition\\n      in 1871 we demanded the enactment of a declaratory law that women\\n      had the right to vote under the first section of the Fourteenth\\n      Amendment. This, too, was denied us, not only by Congress but by\\n      the Supreme Court, which held that the framers of the amendment had\\n      only \"colored men\" in their thought, therefore none others could\\n      come within its purview. From 1876 to the present we have from year\\n      to year poured into Congress hundreds of thousands of petitions\\n      asking you to take the initiative step for another amendment which\\n      shall specifically prohibit the disfranchisement of women.\\n \\n      But, you say, why do you not go to your several States to secure\\n      this right? I answer, because we have neither the women nor the\\n      money to make the canvasses of the thirty-eight States, school\\n      district by school district, to educate each individual man out of\\n      the old belief that woman was created to be his subject. Four State\\n      legislatures submitted the question of striking \"male\" from their\\n      constitutions--Kansas, Michigan, Colorado and Nebraska--and we made\\n      the best canvass of each which was possible for a disfranchised\\n      class outside of all political help. Negro suffrage was again and\\n      again overwhelmingly voted down in various States; and you know,\\n      gentlemen, that if the negro had never had the ballot until the\\n      majority of white men, particularly the foreign born, had voted\\n      \"yes,\" he would have gone without it until the crack of doom. It\\n      was because of this prejudice of the unthinking majority that\\n      Congress submitted the question of the negro\\'s enfranchisement to\\n      the legislatures of the several States, to be adjudicated by the\\n      educated, broadened representatives of the people. We now appeal to\\n      you to lift the decision of _our_ question from the vote of the\\n      populace to that of the legislatures, that thereby you may be as\\n      considerate and just to the women of this nation as you were to the\\n      freedmen.\\n \\n      Every new privilege granted to woman has been by the legislatures.\\n      The liberal laws for married women, the right of the wife to own\\n      and control her inherited property and separate earnings, the right\\n      of women to vote at school elections in a dozen States, full\\n      suffrage in two Territories, all have been gained through the\\n      legislatures. Had any one of these beneficent propositions been\\n      submitted to the vote of the rank and file do you believe a\\n      majority would have placed their sanction upon it? I do not; and I\\n      beg you, Mr. Chairman and gentlemen of the committee, that you will\\n      at once recommend to the House the submission of the proposition\\n      now before you, and thus place the decision of this great\\n      constitutional question of the right of one-half the people of this\\n      republic to a voice in the government, with the legislatures of the\\n      several States. You need not fear that our enfranchisement will\\n      come too suddenly or too soon by this method. After the proposition\\n      shall have passed Congress by the requisite two-thirds vote, it may\\n      require five, ten or twenty years to secure its ratification by the\\n      necessary three-fourths of the State legislatures; but, _once\\n      submitted by Congress, it always will stand until ratified by the\\n      States_.\\n \\n      It takes all too many of us women from our homes and from the works\\n      of charity and education in our respective localities, even to come\\n      to Washington, session after session, until Congress shall have\\n      submitted the proposition, and then to go from legislature to\\n      legislature, urging its adoption. But when you insist that we shall\\n      beg at the feet of each individual voter of every one of the\\n      States, native and foreign, black and white, learned and ignorant,\\n      you doom us to incalculable hardships and sacrifices, and to most\\n      exasperating insults and humiliations. I pray you to save us from\\n      the fate of waiting and working for our freedom until we shall have\\n      educated the ignorant masses of men to consent to give their wives\\n      and sisters equality of rights with themselves. You surely will not\\n      compel us to await the enlightenment of all the freedmen of this\\n      nation and the newly-made voters from the monarchial governments of\\n      the old world!\\n \\n      Liberty for one\\'s self is a natural instinct possessed alike by all\\n      men, but to be willing to accord liberty to another is the result\\n      of education, of self-discipline, of the practice of the golden\\n      rule. Therefore we ask that the question of equality of rights to\\n      women shall be decided by the picked men of the nation in Congress,\\n      and the picked men of the several States in their respective\\n      legislatures.\\n \\n The Senate committee again submitted a majority report in favor of a\\n Sixteenth Amendment enfranchising women, signed by T. W. Palmer, Blair,\\n Lapham and Anthony. The minority report, by Joseph E. Brown, Cockrell\\n and Fair, began: \"The undersigned believe that the Creator intended that\\n the sphere of the males and females of our race should be different,\"\\n etc.\\n \\n The House Judiciary Committee gave a majority report in the\\n negative.[21] The minority report in favor was signed by Thomas B. Reed,\\n Maine; Ezra B. Taylor, Ohio; Thomas M. Browne, Indiana; Moses A. McCoid,\\n Iowa. It is one of the keenest, clearest expositions of the absurdity of\\n the objections against woman suffrage that ever has been made, and ends\\n with this trenchant paragraph:\\n \\n      It is sometimes asserted that women now have a great influence in\\n      politics through their husbands and brothers. That is undoubtedly\\n      true. But this is just the kind of influence which is not wholesome\\n      for the community, for it is influence unaccompanied by\\n      responsibility. People are always ready to recommend to others\\n      what they would not do themselves. If it be true that women can not\\n      be prevented from exercising political influence, is not that only\\n      another reason why they should be steadied in their political\\n      action by that proper sense of responsibility which comes from\\n      acting themselves? We conclude then, that every reason which in\\n      this country bestows the ballot upon man is equally applicable to\\n      the proposition to bestow the ballot upon woman, and in our\\n      judgment there is no foundation for the fear that woman will\\n      thereby become unfitted for all the duties she has hitherto\\n      performed.\\n \\n Miss Anthony mailed 500 packages of copies of this report to different\\n points for distribution. Upon the urgent invitation of the suffrage\\n association of Connecticut she went there for a few days to assist at\\n their State convention, but in a letter to Mrs. Spofford she said: \"I\\n shall return tomorrow night, if possible. I keep thinking of those men\\n at the Capitol not doing what I want them to.\" She afterwards wrote to\\n May Wright Sewall:\\n \\n      My plan is to get away from here the minute I can do so without\\n      letting our work suffer in Congress. A week ago the House Judiciary\\n      Committee voted down a motion to print our \"hearing\" speeches.\\n      Yesterday I went up and called out a Democrat who I knew had voted\\n      \"no,\" and hence could move to reconsider, and he promised to go\\n      back and thus move, and did so, and Mr. Browne, of Indiana, asked\\n      leave of the House to print them. I wish you would write to Mr.\\n      Browne that he is splendid and our main help now in the committee.\\n      Cockrell has been trying to prevent printing the Senate \"hearing,\"\\n      but Blair, Lapham, Palmer and Anthony are bound it shall be\\n      printed. Still, all would fall flat and dead if some one were not\\n      here to keep them in mind of their duty to us.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Yours &c, Thomas M. Browne\"]\\n \\n Miss Anthony remained in Washington till April 14, managing her forces\\n like an experienced general until the last gun had been fired. When she\\n returned home ready to begin work on the History, she found to her\\n amazement that the officer who had been charged with preparing the\\n report of the Sixteenth National Suffrage Convention, a woman of great\\n literary ability, had given it up in despair, declaring that it would be\\n utterly impossible to make anything creditable out of such a mass of\\n unsatisfactory material, most of which would have to be entirely\\n re-written. Miss Anthony did not stop to sit down and weep, but wrote\\n her at once to send to Rochester every document she had in her\\n possession. Then, taking all of them to Mrs. Stanton, who had gone to\\n her old paternal home at Johnstown, they arranged, edited, re-wrote and\\n put into shape the conglomerate of letters, speeches, etc., and in less\\n than two weeks prepared and sent to the printer the most complete report\\n ever made of a National convention.[22]\\n \\n The middle of May, after two years\\' interruption, Miss Anthony and Mrs.\\n Stanton set themselves diligently to finish the third volume of the\\n History of Woman Suffrage, all the boxes and trunks of material having\\n been shipped from Tenafly. Although submerged in the avalanche of old\\n documents, Miss Anthony\\'s mind was full of current events. She writes in\\n her journal June 2: \"I wait with bated breath the news from Oregon,\\n where today the men are voting on the question of woman\\'s\\n enfranchisement. My heart almost stands stills. I hope against hope, but\\n still I hope.\" When the news of the defeat comes, she says: \"Dear Mrs.\\n Duniway, with all that debt left on her shoulders, which she assumed to\\n carry on the campaign! I felt so agonized for her that on the very day\\n of election I rushed to the bank and sent her $100. We must not leave\\n her to carry it alone, after all her brave work. I have written a dozen\\n letters to friends asking them to give her assistance. I feel like a\\n lion champing the bars of his cage, shut up here digging and delving\\n among the records of the past when I long to be out doing the work of\\n the present.\" In a letter received from Senator Palmer at this time he\\n says:\\n \\n      I fully sympathize with your regret and chagrin over the reverse in\\n      Oregon but hardly with your conclusion, viz., that \"the women\\n      should stop asking legislatures to submit this question to the\\n      electors, to have it killed by the majority, made up of ignorance\\n      and whiskey, native and foreign, and all go to Congress for\\n      success,\" etc. It seems to me that nothing is to be lost and much\\n      to be gained by local discussions and temporary defeats. You know\\n      in 1850 Webster, in his unfortunate Revere House speech,\\n      stigmatized the anti-slavery movement as \"a rub-a-dub agitation,\"\\n      and Wendell Phillips closed his masterly philippic thereon with\\n      what was accepted as a motto: Agitate! Agitate!! Agitate!!! Another\\n      decade of that rub-a-dub agitation sufficed to divide the continent\\n      in a political earthquake and from out the chasm the negro emerged\\n      to citizenship. It may still require years to educate a majority of\\n      our women to demand the franchise and a majority of our men or\\n      their representatives in Congress and the legislatures, to proclaim\\n      it, but that the way leads through constant agitation I make no\\n      doubt. The still pool casts nothing to shore.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"With high personal esteem I have the honor to\\n be, Very truly yours, T W Palmer\"]\\n \\n She watches events across the water and writes on July 7: \"Well, the\\n House of Lords is today discussing whether 2,000,000 farm laborers shall\\n have the ballot placed in their hands, while the half-million, more or\\n less, women who employ them are left without it. What an outrage that\\n Mr. Gladstone refused to allow Mr. Woodall\\'s amendment to his bill to be\\n at least voted upon! He applied the party whip and made voting for the\\n woman suffrage amendment disloyalty to the government, and over one\\n hundred Liberals, who had previously declared themselves in favor of\\n women\\'s sharing in this new extension of the franchise, voted against\\n allowing them to do so. I do not believe a more humiliating abnegation\\n of principle at the behest of a party leader ever was witnessed in our\\n Congress.\"\\n \\n The national political conventions in the summer of 1884 received the\\n usual appeal to recognize the claims of women. The Republican,\\n Democratic, Anti-Monopoly and Greenback parties equivocated, although\\n the last two nominated Benjamin F. Butler, an avowed advocate of woman\\n suffrage; the Prohibition convention relegated the question to the\\n States[23]. The American party put in a plank and nominated S. C.\\n Pomeroy, a champion of woman suffrage, but it had too small a following\\n to offer any hope of success. Blaine was not a friend, Logan was an\\n earnest one; Cleveland was not acceptable to many women, Hendricks had\\n never shown himself favorable. In the midst of such a conglomeration the\\n wise thing for all women would have been to remain non-partisan and take\\n no share in the campaign. Miss Anthony and Mrs. Stanton, however,\\n watching events from their secluded nook, issued a manifesto urging\\n women to stand by the Republican party. They were led to take this\\n action by the tendency of large numbers to rush to the support of the\\n Prohibitionists, because of their suffrage plank; and they believed that\\n if women were determined to work for some political party, the\\n Republican at that time held out most hope. This aroused the antagonism\\n of the Prohibitionists and Democrats, both men and women, and afforded\\n the strongest possible object lesson to Miss Anthony of the wisdom of\\n henceforth adhering to her policy of non-partisanship until one of the\\n _dominant_ parties should declare unmistakably for woman suffrage and\\n advocate it by means of press and platform.\\n \\n In August occurred the death of Sarah Pugh, the gentle Quaker and\\n staunch Abolitionist, her old and faithful friend. It was followed by\\n that of Frances D. Gage a few months later; and in December passed away\\n the true and helpful ally, William Henry Channing. Each left a void in\\n her heart, and yet the memory of these great souls impelled to renewed\\n effort. There was no cessation of the work on the History, which was\\n slowly evolved through the heat of summer and the beautiful days of\\n early autumn, but by the end of October the funds were exhausted, the\\n money left by Mrs. Eddy was still in litigation, and Miss Anthony again\\n went on the lecture platform, speaking almost every night through\\n November and December.\\n \\n She did not fail, however, to look carefully after the interests of the\\n Seventeenth National Convention which met as usual in Washington,\\n January 20, 1885. A letter from Clarina Howard Nichols was sent to be\\n read at this meeting, but the hand which penned it was stilled in death\\n before it was received. Of all the pioneer workers with whom Miss\\n Anthony had been associated in the early days so full of scorn, ridicule\\n and abuse, Mrs. Nichols was among the nearest and dearest, a forceful\\n speaker and writer, a tender, loving woman. It was in this convention\\n that the resolution denouncing dogmas and creeds was introduced by Mrs.\\n Stanton, and caused much commotion and heated argument. Miss Anthony\\n opposed it, saying:\\n \\n      I object to the words \"derived from Judaism.\" It does not matter\\n      where the dogma came from. I was on the old Garrison platform, and\\n      found long ago that the settling of any question of human rights by\\n      people\\'s interpretation of the Bible is utterly impossible. I hope\\n      we shall not go back to that war. We all know what we want, and\\n      that is the recognition of woman\\'s perfect equality. We all admit\\n      that such recognition never has been granted in the centuries of\\n      the past; but for us to begin a discussion here as to who\\n      established this injustice would be anything but profitable. Let\\n      those who wish go back into their history, but I beg it shall not\\n      be done on our platform.[24]\\n \\n The public, which always longed for a sensation at these suffrage\\n conventions and was disappointed if it did not come, seized upon this\\n resolution, and press and pulpit made it a text. The following Sunday W.\\n W. Patton, D. D., president of Howard University, preached in the\\n Congregational church of Washington a sermon entitled, \"Woman and\\n Skepticism.\" He took the ground that as soon as women depart from their\\n natural sphere they become skeptical if not immoral. He gave as examples\\n Hypatia, Madame Roland, Harriet Martineau, Frances Power Cobbe and\\n George Eliot! Then turning his attention to America he said that \"the\\n recent convention of woman suffragists gave evidence of atheism and\\n immorality,\" and that \"Victoria Woodhull was the representative of the\\n movement in this country\"[25]. And this when Mrs. Woodhull had not been\\n on the suffrage platform for thirteen years! Miss Anthony and Mrs.\\n Stanton occupied front seats and at the close of the sermon went\\n forward, shook hands with the preacher and Miss Anthony remarked\\n earnestly: \"Doctor, your mother, if you have one, should lay you across\\n her knee and give you a good spanking for that sermon.\" \"O, no,\" said\\n Mrs. Stanton quickly, \"allow me to congratulate you. I have been trying\\n for years to make women understand that the worst enemy they have is in\\n the pulpit, and you have illustrated the truth of it.\" Then, while the\\n great divine was trying to recover his breath, they walked out of the\\n church. The nine days\\' commotion which this produced can be imagined\\n better than described. After some reflection Miss Anthony regretted that\\n she should have been provoked into her remark, but Mrs. Stanton wrote:\\n \"Don\\'t worry a moment. The more I think about it, the better I like it,\\n because it was the most contemptuous thing which could have been said.\\n Like that shot at Lexington, it will go round the world.\"\\n \\n On February 6, Thomas W. Palmer called up in the Senate the resolution\\n for a Sixteenth Amendment and supported it by that masterly speech which\\n ever since has been one of the strongest suffrage campaign documents.\\n At the request of Miss Anthony thousands of copies were sent out under\\n his frank. She went from Washington to Boston to attend a meeting of the\\n National branch of the Massachusetts association, and soon afterwards,\\n on March 2, started for the New Orleans Exposition. She was warmly\\n welcomed by Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick, wife of Judge E. T. Merrick, at\\n whose lovely home she was entertained during part of her stay. It was\\n her first visit to the Crescent City and she was soon deluged with\\n invitations to speak and received many charming tokens of the\\n justly-famed southern hospitality.\\n \\n She spoke before the Woman\\'s Club in the hall of the Continental Guards,\\n with May Wright Sewall, representative from Indiana; gave seven\\n addresses, in as many days, before schools and colleges and, by\\n invitation of the Press Association, spoke in Agricultural Hall at the\\n exposition and visited the headquarters of the different papers. The\\n next day, by request of Commissioner Truman, she gave an address and\\n held a reception at the New York headquarters. Her last appearance was\\n at Tulane Hall under the auspices of the teachers of the city schools.\\n She was everywhere beautifully received, although her doctrines were new\\n and unpopular, and at the close of each meeting her audience crowded\\n about her with words of appreciation and cordiality. Miss Anthony here\\n met for the first time \"Catherine Cole,\" of the editorial staff, and\\n Mrs. Eliza J. Nicholson, owner and manager of the Picayune. The latter\\n presented her with an Indian basket filled to overflowing with orange\\n blossoms, and this tribute was paid in her paper:\\n \\n      THE APOSTLE OF WOMAN\\'S RIGHTS.--Miss Susan B. Anthony has made a\\n      most favorable impression upon the New Orleans public, and has by\\n      her gentleness and courtesy won many friends for herself and her\\n      cause. She came here a total stranger, and recognized the fact that\\n      there were many who did not approve of her or her doctrines. She\\n      has been sincere, truly polite and simply womanly in all her\\n      dealings with the southern people, and by these very qualities has\\n      commanded the respectful esteem of all. Miss Anthony has not\\n      striven to make herself \"solid\" with the people who give the best\\n      dinners.... The workingwoman, the unfashionable woman, have been\\n      made as heartily welcome as the leader of society; and for their\\n      appreciation they have been repaid by the friendship and esteem of\\n      one of the grandest old maids that ever lived.\\n \\n The Times-Democrat and Daily States also gave full and favorable reports\\n of her visit and lectures. The two weeks allowed for this holiday sped\\n quickly away and Miss Anthony left for the North on March 20, laden with\\n luncheon, flowers and many tokens of affection from the women of New\\n Orleans. At Marshall, Tex., she dined with President and Mrs. Culver, of\\n Bishops\\' University, and reached St. Louis Sunday evening, where she was\\n the guest of her nephew, Arthur A. Mosher, and his wife. The next four\\n or five weeks were spent in the lecture field at hard work, under the\\n management of the Slayton Bureau. In answer to her letter of regret at\\n not meeting Mrs. J. Ellen Foster at an Iowa convention, as she had\\n requested, Mrs. Foster wrote: \"I was sorry enough not to see you but I\\n gave the people your message in the evening. Dear soul, how long you\\n have stood for the truth delivered unto you! God bless your words and\\n works. I do not see creeds and dogmas just as you see them, I do not\\n believe in all that you do, but I believe in you!\"\\n \\n The last of April came the long-expected summons to Boston to receive\\n the legacy of Mrs. Eddy, the courts having sustained the will. While\\n eastward bound, crossing the State of Illinois, newspapers were brought\\n on the train announcing the death of Grant, and she writes: \"The weather\\n is lovely and springlike today, but how still and solemn it seems out\\n here on these broad prairies with that great general gone forever!\" The\\n case had been in litigation three years, Benjamin F. Butler appearing\\n for Miss Anthony and Lucy Stone. His fees were very reasonable but\\n several thousand dollars were swallowed up in the suit. The legacy, in\\n first-class securities, stocks, bonds, etc., was paid April 27, each\\n receiving $24,125.[26] Miss Anthony gives an amusing account, in one of\\n her letters, of the awful nightmare she had on board the sleeper going\\n home, when she dreamed that a woman was at the head of her berth\\n stifling her while a man knelt in front, his hand cautiously creeping\\n toward the inside pocket where she had sewed the money and bonds. She\\n awoke with a scream and did not go to sleep again.\\n \\n If this bequest had been left to Miss Anthony for her own personal use,\\n she could not have felt one-half the joy she now experienced in having\\n the means to carry on the work which always had been so seriously\\n impeded for lack of funds. Of course its receipt was heralded far and\\n wide by the papers, and appeals began to pour in from all sides, nor\\n were they always appeals, but often demands. Scores of women considered\\n themselves entitled to a share because the money had been left to\\n further the cause of woman. One wanted it to help lift a mortgage on her\\n home, others to educate their children, to pay a debt, to reward them\\n for the valuable services they had given to woman suffrage, to start a\\n paper, to carry one already started, and so on without end. The men also\\n were willing to relieve her of a portion. \"I am terribly oppressed by it\\n all,\" Miss Anthony writes, \"and nothing would make me happier than to\\n respond to every one, but my money would melt away in a month.\" It was\\n ludicrous and yet pitiful to see certain persons who had repudiated her\\n in days gone by because she was too radical and too aggressive,\\n discovering all at once how much they always had valued her and how\\n anxious they had been for a long time to renew the old friendship--the\\n common story, ancient as the world.\\n \\n The one thing she was determined to do first of all was to complete the\\n History of Woman Suffrage, upon which she and Mrs. Stanton had spent all\\n the days that could be spared for nearly ten years. The work had been\\n delayed by the many other demands upon their time, by their trips\\n abroad, but more than all else by lack of money. The authors were to pay\\n for composition, stereotyping, the making of the plates for the\\n engravings and the printing of the same; Fowler & Wells for the paper,\\n press-work, binding and advertising. Miss Anthony and her co-workers\\n were to receive only 12-1/2 per cent. commission on the sales. It\\n readily may be seen that she did not go into this as a money-making\\n scheme. Her only thought, her only desire, was to collect the facts in\\n connection with the movement to secure the rights of women, before they\\n should be scattered and lost, and to preserve and put them into shape\\n for reference.\\n \\n In preparing the first two volumes she had used every dollar she had\\n been able to earn and all she could obtain from generous friends, and\\n there were still large unpaid bills. Now, with plenty of money at her\\n command, she bought out the rights of Fowler & Wells, and engaged\\n Charles Mann, of Rochester, to print the third volume. Mrs. Stanton had\\n returned to Tenafly, and there Miss Anthony again sent all the trunks\\n and boxes of precious documents. She completed her lecture engagements\\n and the first of June, 1885, found the two women once more hard at work.\\n \\n \"I really think of you with pity these hot midsummer days,\" wrote Mrs.\\n Sewall to Mrs. Stanton, \"under the lash of blessed Susan\\'s relentless\\n energy; but the reflection that she applies it with the most vigor to\\n her own back enables one to regard that instrument, after all, with more\\n admiration than terror.\" It was indeed true that Mrs. Stanton\\'s luxury\\n and ease-loving nature required much urging,[27] and while Miss Anthony\\n took upon herself all the drudgery possible and all the financial\\n anxiety and burden, she was compelled to keep Mrs. Stanton keyed up to\\n do a great portion of the literary work. \"It is the one drawback at\\n every turn,\" she writes, \"that I have not the faculty to frame easy,\\n polished sentences. If I could but do this, I would finish up the\\n History without asking aid of anyone.\" And again: \"It has been the bane\\n of my life that I am powerless to put on paper the glimpses of thoughts\\n which come and go like flashes of lightning.\" As has been said before in\\n these pages, she is a perfect critic and delightful letter-writer, but\\n finds difficulty in doing what is called \"literary work.\" Practice\\n undoubtedly would have enabled her to overcome this, but she felt\\n always that her chief strength lay in executive ability.\\n \\n [Illustration: MISS ANTHONY AND MRS. STANTON.\\n \\n WRITING THE HISTORY OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE.]\\n \\n Early in June Miss Anthony slipped away from the work long enough to go\\n to the Progressive Friends\\' meeting at Kennett Square, Penn., where she\\n was the guest of Deborah Pennock and met, for the first time, Sarah J.\\n Eddy. In her diary she says: \"Last evening as I sat on the sofa Miss\\n Eddy put her arms around me and said, \\'I am so glad I love you; I should\\n have felt very sorry if I had not.\\' And so should I, for the sake of her\\n dear mother and grandfather, who had so much confidence in me.\" The two\\n went on to New York together and then over to Mrs. Stanton\\'s for a\\n little visit, and the friendship formed at that time has been maintained\\n ever since. Later when Miss Eddy was going to Rochester to a convention,\\n Miss Anthony wrote Mrs. Hallowell: \"I am sure you would be glad to\\n entertain her; she is a sweet, lovely little woman; thoroughly\\n sympathizing with everything and everybody that suffers injustice. I am\\n very sorry that sister Mary and I must be away and can not have the dear\\n girl with us.\"\\n \\n Miss Anthony experienced a great disadvantage in being so far away from\\n her publisher, the more especially as she had to send a chapter at a\\n time, read proofs of each as soon as it was set up, send back corrected\\n proof, get the revises, etc., and she soon found it necessary to spend\\n about half her time in Rochester. The women who were preparing the\\n chapters for their respective States delayed the work, neglecting to\\n send them when promised; many occupied twice as much space as had been\\n assigned them and were highly indignant when Mrs. Stanton used the blue\\n pencil unsparingly on their productions. They vented their feelings on\\n Miss Anthony, knowing that nothing they could say would ruffle Mrs.\\n Stanton\\'s equipoise, and she writes in her diary: \"To decide between the\\n two has almost torn me in twain. People who can write are so tenacious,\\n each thinking her own style better than any other, while poor I don\\'t\\n know which is the best.\"\\n \\n Every few weeks she was obliged to rush over to Fayetteville to confer\\n with Mrs. Gage, who was industriously preparing her part of the work.\\n Urgent appeals came from women in Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Kansas\\n and Indiana that they could not possibly make a success of their State\\n conventions unless she came to their assistance, but she steeled her\\n heart against them and stuck closely to her task. From the lecture\\n bureau came a list of ten engagements at $50 a night, but she refused\\n them. Some of the expressions in her letters of those busy days show the\\n state of her mind better than could volumes of description:\\n \\n      All the work of today put aside to grope into the old past. I feel\\n      like rushing to you this very minute, but here Mrs. Stanton and I\\n      are, scratching, scratching every hour, not each other\\'s eyes but\\n      the History papers. I am a fish out of water.... It makes me feel\\n      growly all the time.... I can not get away from my ball and\\n      chain.... I think we\\'ll make things snap and crackle a little....\\n      This is the biggest swamp I ever tried to wriggle through.... We\\'ll\\n      both put on our thinking caps and I guess get quite a lot of\\n      funnies in the reminiscences.... Now here is the publisher\\'s\\n      screech for money.... O, to get out of this History prison!... I am\\n      too tired to write--I mean too lazy.... No warhorse ever panted for\\n      the rush of battle more than I for outside work. I love to make\\n      history but hate to write it.\\n \\n On November 12 Mrs. Stanton\\'s seventieth birthday was celebrated by a\\n large reception held in the parlors of Dr. Lozier in New York, where\\n Mrs. Stanton read a charming paper on \"The Pleasures of Old Age.\" Her\\n daughter, Harriot Stanton Blatch, sent the following bright and breezy\\n message:\\n \\n      ... How I wish I could give my congratulations in the flesh!\\n      Distance is the foe of love. Kiss dear Susan and let her kiss you\\n      for me. On November 12 I shall think of you both, for you two are\\n      not easily separated in my mind, and there will be a tenderness in\\n      my thoughts and a thankfulness that you both have lived. In your\\n      worries over the History, remember that at least one woman\\n      appreciates the fact that her life has been made easier because of\\n      your combined public work. You ought to be overflowing with\\n      gratitude for each other\\'s existence, for neither without the other\\n      would have achieved the work you have accomplished. Every day of\\n      your lives let your hearts praise the good fortune that brought you\\n      together. Friendship is the grandest relation in the world, and I\\n      feel infinitely blessed in having two such women as friends. You\\n      and dear Susan are not yet to be sainted; you have no end of work\\n      in you still, and must labor on for many a long year, and gain many\\n      a triumphant victory. I throw up my cap and cry hurrah for you two\\n      grand old warriors! The curl is from Nora\\'s little head. She shall\\n      be taught to reverence her Queen Mother and Maid of Honor Susan.\\n      Now farewell, dear ladies; I am wishing you on birthdays and every\\n      day a long and happy life.\\n \\n The next morning came the cablegram announcing the sudden death in\\n Switzerland of the mother of Julia and Rachel Foster. Miss Anthony\\n dropped all work when the sisters arrived at New York, went with them to\\n Philadelphia and rendered every possible consolation and assistance. But\\n not even to go to Washington to push the work in Congress and arrange\\n for the National Convention would she delay the task she was so anxious\\n to finish. She wrote scores of letters, however, in regard to both, and\\n the congressmen particularly had reason to feel that she had not\\n forgotten their promises. Her long and persistent labors were rewarded,\\n for the close of 1885 found the whole third volume of the History in the\\n hands of the printers.\\n \\n \\n FOOTNOTES:\\n \\n [19] An official request was sent to the heads of the departments to\\n permit the women employes to attend one session of this convention but\\n it was refused. A few days later permission was given them to go to Mrs.\\n McElroy\\'s reception at the White House, and the male employes were given\\n a half-holiday to attend the exercises on St. Patrick\\'s Day.\\n \\n [20] The Methodist bishops Bowman, Warren, Newman, Haven, Turner and\\n Walters have favored woman suffrage.\\n \\n [21] Signed by Maybury, Michigan; Poland, Vermont; Tucker, Virginia;\\n Hammond, Georgia; Culbertson, Texas; Moulton, Illinois; Broadhead,\\n Missouri; Dorsheimer, New York; Collins, Massachusetts; Seney, Ohio;\\n Bisbee, Florida.\\n \\n [22] Miss Anthony\\'s letters show how desirous she was that everybody who\\n assisted at these conventions should have full measure of credit: \"They\\n are earnest and anxious to do for woman\\'s cause and I want them treated\\n fairly and leniently as to all mistakes.\" Again she writes: \"Since\\n Oregon was never before represented in our conventions, her speakers\\n must have more room in the report than we old stagers.\"\\n \\n [23] When Miss Anthony learned that this action had been taken with the\\n sanction of Frances E. Willard, she pointed out to her in vigorous\\n language how the Prohibition-Republicans had left that party this year\\n because a temperance resolution had failed in the platform committee and\\n had gone over to the Prohibition party, charging that the Republicans\\n were cowardly. Yet the very first act of this Prohibition convention, to\\n which Miss Willard was a delegate, was to abandon the idea of National\\n Supremacy and accept that of State Rights in order to conciliate the\\n southern members. She further said: \"When the time comes in which it\\n will be political expediency for the Prohibition party to throw woman\\n suffrage overboard altogether, over it will go.\" Miss Willard lived to\\n see this prophecy fulfilled at the National Prohibition Convention of\\n 1896.\\n \\n [24] Apropos of this discussion, an amusing anecdote is related of Miss\\n Anthony. When confronted, in an argument, with the passage of scripture,\\n \"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands,\" etc., she replied:\\n \"Gentlemen, no one objects to the husband being the head of the wife as\\n Christ was the head of the church--to crucify himself; what we object to\\n is his crucifying his wife.\"\\n \\n [25] This account of the sermon is taken from the reports of half a\\n dozen reputable newspapers.\\n \\n [26] This is the only instance where a woman has bequeathed a large\\n amount of money to the cause of equal rights, although a number of small\\n bequests have been made. Women have given millions of dollars to\\n churches, charities, and colleges for men but comparatively nothing to\\n secure freedom for those of their own sex.\\n \\n [27] In one of Miss Anthony\\'s letters she relates with amusement that\\n Mr. Stanton had just come in and, seeing his wife lying on the couch,\\n remarked, \"Ah, resting, I see.\" \"No,\" she replied, \"I am exercising by\\n lying down.\"\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n CHAPTER XXXIV.\\n \\n MANY TRIPS--FIRST VOTE ON SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT.\\n \\n 1886-1887.\\n \\n \\n Miss Anthony started for Washington toward the last of January, 1886,\\n with a lighter heart than she had possessed for many years. The dreadful\\n burden of the labor on the History was lifted, all the bills were paid,\\n she had given a helping hand to several of the old workers, which made\\n her very happy, and she had one or two good dresses in her trunk. There\\n was nothing which the paragrapher who hated what Miss Anthony\\n represented, liked so well as to make disagreeable flings at her\\n clothes, and yet it is an indisputable fact of history that she was one\\n of the most perfectly dressed women on the platform, although her tastes\\n were very plain and simple. A lady once wrote her asking if it would not\\n be possible to make the suffrage conventions a little more æsthetic,\\n they were so painfully practical. She sent the letter to Mrs. Stanton,\\n who commented: \"Well now, perhaps if we could paint injustice in\\n delicate tints set in a framework of poetical argument, we might more\\n easily entrap the Senator Edmunds and Oscar Wilde types of Adam\\'s sons.\\n Suppose at our next convention all of us dress in pale green, have a\\n faint and subdued gaslight with pink shades, write our speeches in verse\\n and chant them to a guitar accompaniment. Ah me! alas! how can we reform\\n the world æsthetically?\"\\n \\n The members of Congress always knew when Miss Anthony had arrived in\\n Washington. Other women accepted their word that they were going to do\\n something, and waited patiently at home. Miss Anthony followed them up\\n and saw that they did it. If she could not find them at the Capitol,\\n she went to their homes. If they promised to introduce a certain measure\\n on a certain day, she was in the gallery looking them squarely in the\\n face. If they failed to do it, they found her waiting for them at the\\n close of the session. Senator Blair wrote this humorous note January 15:\\n \"I thought just as likely as not you would come fussing round before I\\n got your amendment reported to the Senate. I wish you would go home.\\n Cockrell has agreed to let me know soon whether he won\\'t allow the\\n report to be made right off without any bother, and I have been to him\\n several times before. I don\\'t see what you want to meddle for, anyway.\\n Go off and get married!\"\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"I hope you will live always in this world.\\n Heaven has got more than it\\'s share of good people already. Sincerely &\\n Respectfully, Henry W. Blair.\"]\\n \\n Miss Anthony has been directly connected with every action taken by\\n Congress or by any congressional committee on the question of woman\\n suffrage. There are on file among her papers hundreds of letters from\\n members during the past thirty years, showing her energy and persistence\\n in compelling attention to this subject, in learning who were its\\n friends, in attempting to convert the doubters and in spurring the\\n believers to effort. This is something for the women of the future to\\n remember.\\n \\n The Eighteenth Annual Convention opened February 17. Prominent features\\n were a fine address by Rev. Rush R. Shippen, of All Souls church, and\\n the first appearance on the platform of Mary F. Eastman, Ada C. Sweet,\\n the pension agent, the eloquent southern speakers, Mrs. Elizabeth A.\\n Meriwether and Mrs. Sallie Clay Bennett, and the talented German, Madame\\n Clara Neymann. Among many letters was one from George W. Childs to Miss\\n Anthony, saying: \"I am always glad to hear from you and I keep track of\\n your continued good work. Do not be discouraged. I take pleasure in\\n sending the enclosed check ($100) with my sincere regards and very best\\n wishes.\"\\n \\n The crowds were so great that policemen had to be stationed at the door\\n to prevent late comers from trying to enter during the evening sessions.\\n The resolutions scored the bill before Congress proposing to\\n disfranchise all Utah women, both Gentile and Mormon, to punish the\\n crime of polygamy. The usual hearing was granted before the\\n congressional committees. The fight for woman suffrage in the\\n Forty-ninth Congress was conducted by Ezra B. Taylor, of Ohio, who\\n prepared the favorable minority report of the House Judiciary Committee.\\n The adverse majority report was signed by John Randolph Tucker, of\\n Virginia.\\n \\n On March 25 \"the general\" slipped up to New York City, to assist her\\n forces at the State convention, and then hastened back to Washington to\\n direct the main line of attack. The diary says:\\n \\n      March 30.--Went to House of Representatives, saw Messrs. Tucker and\\n      Taylor of judiciary committee; both promised to report soon. Then\\n      went to Senate, saw Messrs. Blair, Stanford and Bowen; all agreed\\n      to work to bring up our bill by May 1. In the evening took a cab\\n      and went in a pouring rain to Senator Stanford\\'s, where I spent an\\n      hour. How keen and true are his perceptions in regard to public\\n      questions!\\n \\n      March 31.--Pouring rain, dark and muggy. I went to the Senate; sat\\n      with Mrs. Dolph and Mrs. Stanford; heard Senator Dolph\\'s fine\\n      speech on the admission of Washington Territory as a State and his\\n      splendid word for woman suffrage. Mrs. Dolph took me home in her\\n      carriage.\\n \\n      April 1.--Went to the Senate again to secure pledges for votes and\\n      speeches for the Sixteenth Amendment Bill. Got Senator Dolph\\'s\\n      strongest paragraphs, and at 8 P. M. went to the top floor of the\\n      Associated Press rooms and gave them to Mr. Boynton, who sent them\\n      over the wires.\\n \\n      April 9.--The United States Senate today voted down Eustis\\' motion\\n      to refuse to admit Washington Territory unless the woman suffrage\\n      clause were eliminated from its constitution, 25 to 12. Senator\\n      Ingalls was the only Republican who voted with the enemy.\\n \\n A few days later Miss Anthony received the following from Mrs. Caroline\\n E. Merrick, of New Orleans: \"... I feel defrauded that I never knew you\\n until last year. Judge Merrick says you are the most sensible person he\\n ever met (without any sex qualifications, of course). Like you, I was\\n indignant at Mr. Eustis in regard to his course toward Washington\\n Territory. I was ashamed and blushed for my Louisiana senator that time.\\n Thanks for your sympathy in my illness. When my head lies low I pray\\n that you may find another and even better friend in my State, who will\\n come to the front in the cause of equal rights for women.\" An extract\\n from a letter of Rev. Olympia Brown to Mrs. Stanton shows how much the\\n old workers as well as the young depended upon Miss Anthony: \"I wish to\\n inquire what has become of Susan? You know she is my North Star. I take\\n all my bearings from her, and when I lose sight of her I wander\\n helplessly, uncertain of my course.\"\\n \\n The diary of April 30 says: \"Heard Phoebe Couzins had been taken to Hot\\n Springs, terribly crippled with rheumatism. Wrote her at once and\\n enclosed $100, telling her I wanted it used to provide delicacies and\\n make her comfortable. I have thought it would be Phoebe whom I should\\n take with me on my southern tour next year, but I fear her work is\\n done.\"\\n \\n [Illustration: Caroline E. Merrick (Signed: \"I am thine ever faithfully\\n and affectionately Caroline E. Merrick\")]\\n \\n By the middle of May, 1886, the last bit of History proof was read, and\\n unlimited leave of absence was granted Miss Anthony by her publisher,\\n while the indexer and binder completed the work which was begun in 1876.\\n On the 19th she started for Kansas, stopping for the usual visit in\\n Chicago with her cousins. In Kansas she visited her brothers at\\n Leavenworth and Fort Scott for nearly two months, making an\\n occasional speech. On the morning of July 4, under the auspices of\\n the W. C. T. U., she addressed a large audience at Salina on, \"The\\n powerlessness of woman so long as she is dependent on man for bread.\" In\\n the hot afternoon, as she was about to enjoy a nap, word came that a\\n hundred people had united in a request that she should speak again, as\\n they had come from ten to twenty miles on purpose to hear her; so she\\n returned to the grove, and Mrs. Griffith, State evangelist, kindly\\n yielded her hour. On July 11 Miss Anthony went again to Chicago, and on\\n the 14th spoke at Lake Bluff Camp Meeting, which was under the\\n management of Frances E. Willard. She then visited the summer homes of\\n her cousins and of Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, at Lake Geneva. On this\\n trip she was accompanied by her dearly-loved niece, Susie B., who went\\n with her to Rochester and spent the summer. The diary briefly records:\\n \\n      September 28.--Left Chicago at noon and lunched with Miss Willard\\n      at Rest Cottage, Evanston. Her mother bright and charming at\\n      eighty-two, and Anna Gordon sweet as ever. It was very good to see\\n      Miss Willard under her own roof. Reached Racine in time for the\\n      State convention, was met by a delegation of ladies and taken to\\n      the home of Martha Parker Dingee, niece of the great Theodore\\n      Parker, a lovely woman. Fine audiences.\\n \\n      October 2.--Reached St. Louis at 8 A. M. As I was looking for my\\n      trunk I heard some one cry out, \"Is that you, Susan?\" and there\\n      were Phoebe Couzins and her father. I had made my trip that way for\\n      the special purpose of seeing her, expecting to find her confined\\n      to the house; so I went home and breakfasted with them.\\n \\n      October 4.--Reached Leavenworth and found Mrs. Colby and Mrs. Saxon\\n      ready to begin the campaign for arousing public sentiment to demand\\n      a bill from the next legislature to secure Municipal suffrage for\\n      women. Dr. Ruth M. Wood is the mainspring of the movement here.\\n \\n This series of conventions was held in the congressional districts from\\n October 5 to November 3, Mrs. Laura M. Johns, manager, assisted by Mrs.\\n Anna C. Wait, president of the State Association, and by a number of\\n capable and energetic Kansas women at each place visited. Under date of\\n October 11, Miss Anthony wrote to eastern friends: \"We are having the\\n loveliest weather you ever dreamed of and the most magnificent\\n audiences--no church or hall holding them. If our legislators, State or\\n national, could only see these gatherings and look into the earnest\\n faces of these people, coming so many miles in wagons to see and hear\\n and get fresh courage, they would surely answer our demands by something\\n else than silence.\" The press corroborated this description and the\\n following special dispatch may be taken as a fair specimen:\\n \\n      The seventh district convention, the third of the series, has just\\n      closed in Lincoln, and was a beautiful ovation to Miss Anthony.\\n      Crowded houses greeted her--every available foot of space filled\\n      with chairs, window-sills utilized for seats, and conveyances drawn\\n      up outside of windows and filled with listeners. People came\\n      thirty, forty and fifty miles in buggies and wagons to shake hands\\n      with the pioneer suffragist. Grizzly-headed opposers succumbed to\\n      Miss Anthony\\'s logic and came up to grasp her hand and say God\\n      bless her, and proved the depth of their fervor by generous\\n      financial aid to the cause she so ably represents. It is seldom\\n      that the beginner of a great reform lives to see such fruitage of\\n      her labors as does she. People often descant upon the indifference\\n      of women to the question of their own enfranchisement and to\\n      political matters generally; but there is serious doubt of greater\\n      interest ever having been shown by men in political meetings than\\n      women exhibit in these conventions....\\n \\n      On the evening of the second day the house was so densely packed\\n      that a messenger for a glass of water had to go out through a\\n      window. But in spite of all discomfort and the many standing, the\\n      audience maintained perfect order and gave the utmost attention\\n      throughout Miss Anthony\\'s speech of two hours. Learning that she\\n      would remain in Lincoln over Sunday the people importuned her to\\n      speak that afternoon in the Presbyterian church, which she did to a\\n      large audience.\\n \\n The diary relates: \"A mother brought her four-weeks-old girl baby\\n twenty-five miles in a carriage, so she might tell it, when grown, that\\n Susan B. Anthony had taken it in her arms. \\'And the trip has not hurt\\n baby a particle,\\' she said brightly.\" And again it tells, with a good\\n deal of gusto, that one Baptist minister was determined the suffrage\\n speakers should not have his church and only yielded after several of\\n the richest pew-holders declared they never would pay another dollar\\n towards his salary if he did not. He then made his appearance at the\\n meeting, opened it with his blessing and closed it with his benediction!\\n Miss Anthony was not always able to speak to her own satisfaction. At\\n Salina she lectured for the Y. M. C. A. and writes: \"I went to the\\n opera house and found a fine audience. Tried to give \\'Moral Influence\\n vs. Political Power,\\' but the spirit wouldn\\'t soar; its wings flapped on\\n the earth perpetually for the whole hour. I took my $25 from the\\n treasurer and went home with a heavy heart. It is beyond my knowledge\\n why, after speaking every day for a whole week, freely and decently, my\\n wits should desert me and my tongue be tied just at the time when I am\\n most anxious to do my best.\"\\n \\n Two days\\' meetings were held at Abilene, Florence, Hutchinson, Wichita,\\n Anthony, Winfield, Independence, Lawrence and Fort Scott. The speakers\\n were entertained by prominent families, suffrage societies were formed\\n at each place, the vast majority of public sentiment seemed favorable,\\n and the collections paid all the expenses of the conventions.\\n \\n In November and December a number of other speakers made a canvass of\\n the State, and the following winter the legislature passed a bill\\n conferring Municipal suffrage upon the women of Kansas. The bill was\\n introduced in the Senate by R. W. Blue (Rep.) of Linn county; and in the\\n House by T. T. Taylor (Rep.) of Reno county. It passed the Senate, 25\\n ayes, all Republicans; 13 noes, 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats; in the\\n House 90 ayes, 84 Republicans and 6 Democrats; 21 noes, 5 Republicans\\n and 16 Democrats. The bill was signed by Governor John A. Martin,\\n February 15, 1887; and under its provisions women in that State have\\n voted ever since at Municipal elections.[28]\\n \\n Without a day\\'s rest, Miss Anthony went direct from Kansas to Sandwich,\\n Ill., to attend the State convention. After three days there and a\\n Sunday in Chicago, Monday, November 8, found her at Racine, Wis., ready\\n to begin a tour of conventions in every congressional district. That\\n evening a reception was given her by Hon. and Mrs. M. B. Erskine, and\\n the hospitality of their handsome home was offered for every day which\\n she could spend in the city.\\n \\n With Mrs. Colby and Rev. Olympia Brown, assisted by local speakers,\\n meetings were held at Waukesha, Ripon, Oshkosh, Green Bay, Grand Rapids,\\n Eau Claire, LaCrosse, Evansville, Milwaukee and Madison. At the last\\n place the ladies spoke in the Senate chamber of the State House to an\\n audience containing a number of dignitaries, among them President\\n Bascom, of the State University, and his wife, who from this time were\\n Miss Anthony\\'s steadfast friends. Mrs. Colby gives a graphic description\\n of Miss Anthony\\'s sudden outburst here, when several members had\\n exasperated her by their remarks, which closes: \"I was writing at the\\n secretary\\'s desk and as I looked up I realized the full grandeur of the\\n scene. It was woman standing at the bar of the nation, pleading for the\\n recognition of her citizenship. Miss Anthony seemed positively Titanic\\n as she leaned far over from the speaker\\'s desk. Her tone and manner were\\n superb, and the vast and sympathetic audience caught the electric\\n thrill....\" In this city she was the guest of an old schoolmate,\\n Elizabeth Ford Proudfit. The meetings closed December 3, and Miss\\n Anthony wrote Mrs. Spofford:\\n \\n      I intend now to make straight for Washington without a stop. I\\n      shall come both ragged and dirty. Think of two solid months of\\n      conventions, speaking every night! Don\\'t worry about me. I was\\n      never better or more full of hope and good work. Though the apparel\\n      will be tattered and torn, the mind, the essence of me, is sound to\\n      the core. Please tell the little milliner to have a bonnet picked\\n      out for me, and get a dressmaker who will patch me together so I\\n      shall be presentable. Now for the Washington convention: Before\\n      settling upon the Universalist church, you would better pocket the\\n      insults and refusals of the Congregational church powers that be\\n      and send your most lovely and winning girls to ask for that. If you\\n      can\\'t get it or the Metropolitan or the Foundry or the New York\\n      Avenue or any large and popular church, why take the Universalist,\\n      and then tell the saints of the fashionable churches that we dwell\\n      there because they refused us admission to their holy sanctuaries.\\n      Don\\'t let us go into the heterodox houses, much as I love them,\\n      except because we are driven away from the orthodox.\\n \\n In December the third volume of the History of Woman Suffrage at last\\n was ready for the public, another book of nearly 1,000 pages. It\\n completed the story up to 1884, and like its predecessors was cordially\\n received by the press. The money swallowed up by this work hardly will\\n be credited. Mrs. Stanton not being able or willing to revise the last\\n volume until it was put into proof slips, and then making extensive\\n changes, the cost for re-setting type was over $900. The fifty fine\\n steel engravings and the prints made from them cost over $6,000. For\\n proof reading $500 was paid, and for indexing, $250. Mrs. Stanton and\\n Mrs. Gage, seeing that there never would be any profits from the books\\n and that Miss Anthony proposed to give most of them away, sold out their\\n rights to her, the former for $2,000 and the latter for $1,000. She\\n also, as has been stated, bought out the interest of Fowler & Wells.\\n When the first edition of the three mammoth volumes finally came into\\n her sole possession, they represented an outlay on her part of $20,000.\\n \\n While there were many criticisms from certain quarters as to various\\n errors and so-called misstatements, and many threats to write a history\\n which should be free from all imperfections, the fact remains that,\\n although fifty years have passed since the inception of the great\\n movement to secure equal rights for women, there never has been another\\n attempt to preserve the story. But for Miss Anthony\\'s careful collecting\\n and saving of newspaper accounts, manuscripts of speeches, published\\n reports and the correspondence of half a century, her persistent and\\n determined effort for ten years to have them put into readable shape,\\n and Mrs. Stanton\\'s fine ability to do it, the student never would have\\n been able to trace the evolution of woman from a chattel in the eye of\\n the law to a citizen with legal and social rights very nearly equal to\\n those of man. While there is necessarily some repetition, so long a time\\n elapsing between the writing of the different volumes, and perhaps a\\n little prolixity, there is not a dull page in the whole work and the\\n reader will find it difficult to reach a place where she is willing to\\n stop. It contains a resumé of early conditions; the persecutions endured\\n by the pioneers in the struggle for freedom; the progress in each\\n separate State, and in foreign countries; the action taken by different\\n legislatures and congresses; the grand arguments made for equal rights;\\n the position of woman in church and State. Into whatever library the\\n student may go seeking information upon this question, it is to these\\n volumes he must look to find it in collected and connected form. If Miss\\n Anthony had done no other work but to produce this History, she would\\n deserve a prominent place on the list of immortal names.\\n \\n It was necessary to put so high a price upon it, $15 a set in cloth and\\n $19.50 in leather binding, as to make a large sale impossible. Miss\\n Anthony did not undertake it as a money-making scheme, and when the\\n receipt of Mrs. Eddy\\'s bequest enabled her to discharge all indebtedness\\n connected with it, she felt herself at liberty to use it as a most\\n valuable means of educating the people into an understanding of the\\n broad principle of equality of rights. At her own expense she placed the\\n History in over 1,000 of the libraries of Europe and America, including\\n the British Museum, the university libraries of Oxford, Edinburgh,\\n Dublin, Paris, Berlin, Finland, Melbourne, Toronto, and many of the\\n university and public libraries of the United States. The members of the\\n Senate and House Judiciary Committees in several Congresses were\\n presented with sets, and there are hundreds of letters on file from\\n prominent persons in England and this country acknowledging the receipt\\n of the books.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"Faithfully yours, H B Anthony\"]\\n \\n Chapters might be made of commendatory letters received from officials,\\n writers, public workers and friends in private life. A few specimens\\n must suffice. A letter from Senator H. B. Anthony to his \"dear cousin,\"\\n closed by saying: \"The three volumes form a valuable history of the\\n important enterprise in which you have borne so conspicuous and\\n honorable a part, and you have added to the reputation of the name that\\n we both bear.\"\\n \\n Mary L. Booth, the gifted editor of Harper\\'s Bazar, thus expressed her\\n opinion of the work:\\n \\n      You and your colleagues have industriously placed on record a\\n      copious mass of documentary evidence which will be of the utmost\\n      value when the time arrives to sum up the final results. When this\\n      era comes, you will be foremost among the band of heroic pioneers\\n      who have endured discomfort, obloquy and privation of much that is\\n      dear to women for the sake of those who will profit by your labors\\n      while failing to recognize them. Posterity will do you this\\n      justice, whether your contemporaries do or not; but indeed, it is\\n      universally known to those with any knowledge of the facts, that\\n      among all the champions of women, none has been more distinguished\\n      for utter self-abnegation, single-heartedness and devotion to her\\n      life-work than Susan B. Anthony.\\n \\n      As you know, I have always felt the deepest interest in the\\n      elevation of women, which is synonymous with that of humanity, for\\n      man must be always on the plane of his wife, sister and mother....\\n      The antagonism to political equality is rapidly disappearing, as it\\n      is beginning to be recognized that in politics, as in everything\\n      else, woman\\'s help is needed, and the republic can not afford to\\n      have her stand aloof. But this phase of the subject has been so\\n      much misunderstood, both by men and women, that time is needed to\\n      clear away the mists of misconception which envelop it; and to\\n      prove that the co-operation of women in political life is not only\\n      just and expedient, but absolutely indispensable to the public\\n      weal.\\n \\n [Illustration: Autograph: \"I am now and always, Yours faithfully, Mary\\n L. Booth\"]\\n \\n No family in Rochester stood more steadfastly by Miss Anthony during all\\n her long and eventful life than the Wilders--Carter, Samuel, Mrs. Maria\\n Wilder Depuy and D. Webster. The last, in acknowledging the receipt of\\n the books, wrote: \"How much you have contributed to history in this\\n grand publication! With woman as a part of humanity, what a revolution\\n will be wrought! Changes everywhere--in social life, in morals,\\n politics, business--and all for the better. In this world-revolution you\\n have done a great work. My children are proud of the fact that you are\\n my personal friend. I fully appreciate your gift. It will be a Bible in\\n my home.\" From the philanthropist, Sarah B. Cooper, revered for her work\\n in the kindergartens on the Pacific coast, came this tribute:\\n \\n      This book is the fruitage of all the years of your faith and work.\\n      It tells of the long preparation--the opening up of the forest; the\\n      blazing of the trail; the clearing of the underbrush; the deep\\n      sub-soiling; the lying fallow; the ploughing, sowing, harrowing,\\n      the patient tillage--and now comes the harvest. What courage,\\n      endurance, fidelity and faith! The pioneers of new thoughts and\\n      principles are the loneliest of mortals. Those who live ahead of\\n      their time must wait for the honors and plaudits of posterity to\\n      get their full meed of appreciation and reward. But after all,\\n      dear, honored friend, the richest reward of such a life as yours is\\n      _to have lived it_.'"

       "'CHAPTER XXXII MISS ANTHONYS EUROPEAN LETTERS 1883 No pen so well as Miss Anthonys own can describe her delightful tour abroad and although her letters were dashed off while travelling from point to point or at the close of a hard days sight-seeing and the entries in the diary are a mere word they tell in a unique way her personal impressions Because of limited space descriptions of scenery will be omitted in order to leave room for opinions of people and events ON BOARD THE BRITISH PRINCE February 24 MY DEAR MRS SPOFFORD Here we are at noon Friday steaming down Delaware Bay We got along nicely until 3 P M yesterday when we came to a standstill Stuck in the mud was the report There we lay until eight when with the incoming tide we made a fruitless attempt to get over the bar then had to steam back up the river to anchor and lie there until nine this morning--twenty-four hours almost in sight of the loved ones! It is a break from all fastenings to friends to be thus cut loose from the wharf and wafted out into the waters These long hours of delay have given me time to think of those left behind and how very far short I have come of doing and saying all I should have done and said From the diary Feb 24--The weather lovely saloon cozy and pleasant with piano flowers and canaries There are only seven passengers among them a Catholic priest a dear little three-year-old child and a baby We sent twenty letters on shore written during the day we have been detained Feb 25--Today dawns with no possibility of communicating with a soul outside the ship a lonely feeling indeed but I am determined to get all the good I can to mind and body out of this trip and as little harm as possible Feb 26--I sit at the captains right hand at table The sea is perfectly smooth I wonder if this broad expanse can be rolled up into mountains 4 PM--The wind and waves are beginning to roar The priest shows signs of surrender Mar 2--Sea calm and dishes no longer have to be fastened to table It seems like freedom again I can think of nothing beyond shipboard can see no moves to be made when we reach Liverpool Mar 4--Winds fair sea smooth whole company at breakfast Captain Burton read the church service Rachel played the piano and led the singing ON BOARD THE BRITISH PRINCE March 5 MY DEAR SISTER MARY At lunch the captain said Ill soon show you land! It will be Mizzenhead the farthest southwest point of Ireland This is the first pen put to paper since I wrote you at the Delaware breakwater eleven days ago Think of it oh ye scribbling fairies almost two weeks and not a letter written by S B A! Well we are thus far and have had no more than what the sailors call a stiff breeze and only two whiffs of that sort Since Thursday the weather has been lovely--bright sun and crisp air Rachel succumbed one night when the stiff breeze first opened upon us and I felt a little squalmy The next morning a sudden lurch of the ship took both feet from under me and I was flat on my back The following day while I was lying on a seat reading and half-dozing the first I knew I was in a heap on the floor Then I learned it wasnt safe to lie down without a board fence in front Again in the evening I had taken the one loose chair in the saloon drawn it under a lamp and seated myself very complacently to read when lo I was pitched over as if propelled from a ten-pounder! Three times and out--all in rapid succession--taught me to trust not to myself at all but always to something fast to the ship I havent lost a meal during the whole trip Another time I should take a larger stock of oranges lemons and other fruit 3 P M--We have just been up on the bridge for a first sight of the Emerald Isle So long as there was no immediate prospect of setting foot on land I could get up no spirit to write or think I have worn the old velvet-trimmed black silk dress right through and it is pretty well salted I should love to have Lucy and Louise and Maud along on this trip with sister Mary too What a jolly lot of tramps we would make! Well their one ray of hope is to pull through the free academy and get on their own feet There is plenty of good in store for all who can bring themselves in line to get it Holding a dish right side up to catch the shower is the work for each one of us How much I do think and hope for the three nieces now entering womanhood For Susie B Jr and little Anna O and Gula I shall think and hope by and by As for the nephews I do not forget them but theyll fight their way through somehow as have all boys before them Dinner is over and an hours talk at table after it The Englishman Mr Mullinor summed up Your country will come to ruin from such doctrines as you womans rights folks advocate and I have put the case to him to the best of my sea-brains ability This is the very first time I have let my tongue loose We expect to be in Liverpool tomorrow early and then I will write you Just take it for granted all is well with me and I will try to do the same with you Miss Anthony found at Liverpool a cordial letter from Mrs A A Sargent whose husband was now United States Minister to Germany She welcomed her to Europe saying You always have the entree to our home and hearts Come and stay as long as you will A note from Mrs Stanton to her beloved Susan said I came up to London the moment I heard of the arrival of the British Prince To think of your choosing a Prince when a Queen was coming! I am on the tiptoe of expectation to meet you I write in the suffrage rooms surrounded with ladies A week later the diary records Left London at 10 A M for Rome Rachel and self also Hattie Daniels Alice Blatch and Mrs Fanny Keartland five in all three of the Eagle and two of the Lion each glorying in her own nationality! ROME NO 75 VIA NAZIONALE March 22 MY DEAR SISTER Here it is a whole month tomorrow since we took a last glimpse of each other and scarce a decent letter have I written you but it is fearfully hard work to find the minutes There is so much to tell and the spelling and pronunciation of the names are so perfectly awful At Liverpool we drove two hours in the Princess and Sefton parks and then went to the city museum where the most interesting things to us were the portraits of all the Bonapartes--men and women old and young--Josephines very lovely and to the city library which is free There is also an immense free lecture hall which was built for an aquarium but found impracticable so it is an enormous circle seated from the circumference down to the center with a large platform at one side and every step and seat cut out of solid stone Here the most learned men of the English colleges give free lectures the city fund being ample to meet all expenses The librarian on hearing we were Americans took great pains to show us everything Of course when he said We have over 80000 volumes I asked Have you among them the History of Woman Suffrage by Mesdames Stanton etc of America? And lo he had never heard of it! Thursday morning we took train--second-class carriage--for London Mrs Stanton was at the station her face beaming and her white curls as lovely as ever and we were soon landed at our boarding-house Lydia Becker came to dinner by Mrs Stantons invitation so she was the first of Englands suffrage women for us to meet Friday afternoon we glanced into the House of Commons and happened to see Gladstone presenting some motion Spent the evening chatting with Mrs Stanton--a world of things to talk over Saturday we went again to Bayswater to see Mrs Rose--found her very lonely because of the death of her devoted husband a year ago She threw her arms around my neck and her first words were O that my heart would break now and you might close my eyes dear Susan! She is vastly more isolated in England because of her non-Christian views than she ever was in America Sectarianism sways everything here more now than fifty years ago with us That afternoon I left for Basingstoke the new home of darling Harriot Stanton now with Blatch suffixed Her husband is a fine specimen of a young Englishman of thirty Sunday morning he took me in a dog-cart through two gentlemens parks a pleasant drive through pasture and woodland thousands of acres enclosed by a stone wall When I said What a shame that all these acres should thus lie waste while myriads of poor people are without an inch of ground whereon to set foot he replied They would be no better off if all should be cut up into forty-acre farms and divided among the poor for no man could possibly support a family upon one The owners of these parks are actually reduced to poverty trying to keep them up So you see it is of no use to talk of giving every Englishman a farm when the land is so poor no one can make a living off of it Of course this is not true of all England but evidently its inhabitants must be fed from other countries On our return I was conducted through the garden and green-house of Mr Blatchs father where I saw peach trees in blossom and grape vines budding The tree-trunks were not larger than my arm and I exclaimed How many peaches can you get off these little trees? Why last year we had 250 said he How is that by the side of our old farm harvest of 1000 trees? And yet these English people talk as if they raised fruit! The next day I returned to London and Mrs Stanton and I called on Rev William Henry Channing at the West End and had a two hours chat with him He was very cordial and on our leaving said I cant tell you how grateful I am for this interview You have my blessing and benediction so we were glad at heart Mr Channing loves America above all other countries and feels it was a mistake for him to have left it His elder daughter is the wife of Edwin Arnold March 12 we dined with the son-in-law of William Ashurst the friend of Wm Lloyd Garrison--Mr Biggs and his four daughters Caroline Ashurst Biggs the second is the editor of the Englishwomans Review and one of the leading suffrage women of England Illustration Autograph Very sincerely yours Caroline A Biggs After dinner some twenty ladies and gentlemen came in and we had a delightful evening but such a continual serving of refreshments! Illustration Mentia Taylor Signed Yours very sincerely Mentia Taylor Tuesday morning I went again to Mrs Roses and finding her bonneted and cloaked for a chair ride I walked beside her holding her hand through Kensington Park I hope and almost believe she will go back to America with me I feel sure that we who have not forgotten her early and wonderful work for woman and for freedom of thought will do all in our power to smooth her last days That evening Rachel and I went to see Irving and Ellen Terry in Much Ado About Nothing The painting and the lights and shadows of the scenery were lovely and I suppose the acting was good but I can not enjoy love and flirtation exhibited on the stage any more than off All passional demonstrations seem to belong to the two concerned not to other persons The lovemaking however was cooler more distant and more piquant than usual Wednesday afternoon Mrs Rebecca Moore our old Revolution correspondent took me to a meeting at Mrs Müllers about the Contagious Diseases Acts--fifty or sixty ladies present--was introduced and several invited me to speak for them when I returned to London Miss Rye who has made between thirty and forty trips across the Atlantic with little girls taking over more than 10000 and placing them in good homes in Canada was there and spoke She said all her efforts could accomplish nothing in thinning out the more than 1000000 surplus women of the island Not one seemed to dare speak out the whole of the facts and philosophy Each promised I will not shock you by calling the names etc Mrs Peter Taylors reception that evening was an unusually brilliant affair She is looked upon as the mother of the English movement as Mrs Stanton is of the American She is a magnificent woman and acted the part of hostess most gracefully Her husband is a member of Parliament At eleven we went home and packed our trunks to be off for Rome on the morrow half-regretting that we had planned to leave London ROME March 23 MY DEAR SISTER It is noon--Good Friday--and just set in for a steady rain so I will give you the goings seeings and sayings of our company since leaving London We started from Victoria Station--second-class carriage no sleeper--for a three days and two nights journey to Rome It looked appalling even to so old a traveller as myself but I inwardly said I can stand it if the younger ones can The crossing of the straits of Dover was rough the sea dashing over the sides of the boat but Rachel and I went through the two hours without a quaver At Calais we had the same good luck as at London--a compartment of the car all to ourselves Here we were to be settled without change for that night and the next day so with bags and shawl-straps bundles lunch-baskets and a peck of oranges we adjusted ourselves We breakfasted at Basle after having pillowed on each other for the night as best we could Now we were in the midst of the Jura mountains and all day long we wound up and down their snowy sides and around the beautiful lakes nestling at their feet--through innumerable tunnels one of them the St Gothard taking twenty-three minutes--over splendid bridges and along lovely brooks and rivers We arrived at Milan at 750 P M when even the bravest of our party voted to stop over twenty-four hours and try the virtues of a Christian bed Rachel and I shared a large old-fashioned room with a soap-stone stove where we had a wood-fire built at once Remember that all the houses have marble floors and stairs and are plastered on the stone walls so they seem like perfect cellars We had two single bedsteads I havent seen any other sort on the continent with the same bedclothes covering both Our big room was lighted with just two candles! We slept solid till 8 A M when Rachel got out her Italian phrase-book rang the bell and ordered a fire and hot water After fairly good steak and coffee we five began a day of steady sight-seeing In the evening we went to the station and here found a wood-fire in a fireplace and monstrous paintings of Christ and the saints on the walls All who had trunks had now to pay for every pounds weight I had brought only my big satchel and shawl-strap We were not so fortunate as to find a compartment to ourselves but had two ladies added to our number while four or five men in the next one smoked perpetually and the fumes came over into ours We growled but that availed nothing as men here have the right of way At Genoa the ladies left us--midnight--and two men took their places These proved to be seafarers and could talk English so we learned quite a bit from them At ten we were halted and rushed in to breakfast Sunday afternoon we reached the Eternal City and came direct to the Pension Chapman tired and hungry but later went to St Johns Cathedral to vespers After dinner we were glad to lay ourselves away We have a pleasant room with windows opening upon a broad court and lovely garden and fountain Monday we drove around the city for birds-eye views from famous points Such wonders of ruins upon ruins! Sunday Evening--It is of no avail that I try and try to write-when the sight-seeing is done for the day I am too tired Last evening the Coliseum was illuminated--a weird wonderful sight Today Easter Sunday I have seen crowds of people reverently kissing St Peters big toe Tomorrow we go to Naples for a week and then return and finish Rome NAPLES March 27 Here we are Rachel and I at the Pension Brittanique far up a high hill in a room overlooking the beautiful bay of Naples It is lovely lovely! The little island of Capri the city the bold shores and mountain setting--a perfect gem We have a little bit of wood-fire with the smallest sticks--twigs we should call them--two sperm candles to light our bedroom and no matches except what we furnish But 8 oclock is here and we are all to meet for breakfast Yesterday was a lovelyMay_ day and our party drove to the village of Resina which is built forty feet above the ruins of Herculaneum There with a guide we descended a hundred steps and walked through the old theater over the same stone stairs and seats which two thousand years ago were occupied by the gayest of mortals Then we went to the ruins of Pompeii and ate our lunch under large old trees growing upon the debris left by the great eruption We passed through the narrow streets over stone pavements worn by the tread of long-buried feet through palaces public gardens and baths temples the merchants exchange customhouse and magnificent theater I have just received John Brights splendid address before the 2000 students of Glasgow University on being made Lord Rector It fired my soul beyond all the ruins and all the arts in Rome or Naples It is grand indeed and reminds one of our own Wendell Phillips address to the Harvard students two years ago14 ROME March 29 To Madam Susan B Anthony of New York U S A_ MADAM We had the honor to announce your coming to Rome some three weeks ago in the Italian Times While we ourselves have an impressive appreciation of your distinguished mental acquirements yet we would wish to carry to our numerous English-speaking subscribers on this continent some testimony of your presence in our midst Therefore we place our columns at your disposal and will esteem the privilege of presenting to the public any topic your facile pen may write To this end we will wait upon you or be pleased to see you at our sanctum With much respect we are Madam your obedient servants THE PROPRIETORS OF THE ITALIAN TIMES Only English newspaper published in Italy ROME April 1 DEAR BROTHER D R We have climbed Vesuvius One feels richly paid when the puffing and exploding and ascending of the red-hot lava meet the ears and eyes The mountains the Bay of Naples the sail to Capri and the Blue Grotto are fully equal to my expectations The squalid-looking people however and their hopeless fate make ones stay at any of these Italian resorts most depressing Troops of beggars beset one all along the streets and roads and with tradesmen there is no honesty For instance a man charged some twenty francs for a shell comb then came down to seven six five and finally asked What will you give? I never dreaming he would take it said two francs and he threw the comb into the carriage Saturday we took the cars from Naples to Palermo Every mountainside having a few seven-by-nine patches of soil in a place is terraced and covered with grape vines and lemon trees the latter now yellow with fruit On many I counted twenty and thirty terraces each with a solid stone wall to hold the earth in place It is wonderful what an amount of labor it costs to earn even the little the natives seem to care for Our hotel here is an old monastery and on one side of the court is the cathedral with its grotesque paintings One becomes fairly sickened with the ghastly spectacle of the dead Christ It is amazing how little they make of the living Christ On Monday morning we drove back over that magnificent road and took the train to Naples In the afternoon we went to Lake Avernus and into the grotto of the sibyls the entrance to Dantes Inferno It was a dark cavernous passage and with the flaring candles making the darkness only more visible we could not but feel there was reason for the old superstition The narrowness of the streets of Naples--and they are without the pretense of a sidewalk--leave the men women and children horses and carriages funny little donkeys with their big loads the cows and goats which are each night and morning driven along and halted at the doors while the pint cupful more or less is milked to supply the people within all marching along together in the filthy road jostling each other at every step But we are back in Rome now and this forenoon we spent in the galleries of the Vatican One is simply dazed with the wealth of marble--not only statuary but stairs pillars and massive buildings We stop here till the 9th then go to Florence15 It is good for our young civilization to see and study that of the old world and observe the hopelessness of lifting the masses into freedom and freedoms industry honesty and integrity How any American any lover of our free institutions based on equality of rights for all can settle down and live here is more than I can comprehend It will be only by overturning the powers that education and equal chances ever can come to the rank and file The hope of the world is indeed in our republic so let us work to make it agenuine_ democracy where every citizen--woman as well as man--shall be crowned with the one symbol of equality--the ballot ROME April 5 MY DEAR SISTER How these anniversary days of our dear mothers illness and death bring back to me everything even at this distance and amid these strange surroundings How she would have enjoyed these sights because of her knowledge and love of history She could have told the Bible story of every one of these great frescoes What a woman she would have been could she have had the opportunities of education and culture which her granddaughters are having Tell Mrs Lewia Smith her lovely piece of lace has been honored with the wearing in London and Rome several times and has been pronounced beautiful but I prize it most of all for the givers sake No one but she would have trudged through the slush and rain to get those splendid names to that testimonial Nothing which came to me gave so much pleasure as those signatures of my own townsmen and women from President Anderson all the way to the end of the list This evening Rachel has gone to a friends to study German so as to make our way with that nationality What a jumble that by just crossing an imaginary line one finds people who cant understand a word one says! Last evening we heard the grand Ristori render a part of Dantes Inferno and a selection from Joan of Arc Of course I couldnt understand a word she said but her voice her gestures her expression told the whole story Then the music vocal and instrumental was the softest and sweetest ZURICH April 23 MY DEAR SISTER We spent Friday night at Milan--there took our last look at Italian cathedrals as we did our first and its own still holds highest place as to beauty We left early next morning and very soon were among the Alps The eleven hours stretch was tiresome and disgusting inside our compartment with from three to five stalwart men puffing away at their pipes all day long and at every station rushing out for a drink of wine or beer Our only chance of a free breath was to open the window and then all the natives were in consternation! We reached Zurich at six and after a splendid dinner of roast chicken green peas and lettuce took a cab and called on Elizabeth Sargent who is studying medicine at the university and found her very happy and glad to see us In the afternoon we took a delightful drive as it was too cold and misty for the lake excursion we had intended The highest Alps are still lost to us by fog and clouds After supper we called at the American consulate Think of our government supporting a consul in most of the twenty-two cantons of Switzerland! Tuesday--At Munich We saw princes and princesses galore out driving this afternoon but not the king We leave tomorrow morning for Nuremberg and reach Berlin Saturday and there I hope to rest at least a week--but then the Emperor William must be seen and lots of other curiosities If I could command the money as soon as each of our girls graduated I would take her first on a tour of her own continent and then through the old world before she settled down to the hard work of life either in a profession or in marriage Thus she would have much to think of and live over no matter how heavy might be the burdens and sorrows of her after life COLOGNE May 8 MY DEAR SISTER We left Berlin yesterday morning after a delightful week with the Sargents I do not believe our nation ever has been represented at any foreign court by such genuine republican women in the truest and broadest sense as are Mrs Sargent and her daughters Mr Sargent too touches the very height of democratic principle Their association with monarchial governments and subjects but makes them love our free institutions the more16 Our last evening was spent with the Frau Dr Liburtius--formerly Henriette Hirschfeldt--a practicing dentist in Berlin since 1869 who studied at the Philadelphia Dental College No college in Germany will admit women Frau Libertius is dentist for various members of the royal family as well as for the Sisters of Charity She says there are no dental colleges in the world equal to those of America May 10--At Worms--where Martin Luther made his glorious declaration for the right of private judgment There is a magnificent monument in a beautiful square Luthers is the central statue--a standing one below at the corners are sitting Huss Savonarola Wycliffe and Peter Waldo and on a still lower pedestal are four more worthies--one of them Melancthon We spent Tuesday at Cologne--visited the splendid cathedral and the church of St Ursula The latter contains the bones of 11000 virgins martyred at Cologne in the fifth century Whole broadsides of chapels are lined with shelves of skulls which the noble ladies of the twelfth century partly covered with embroidery Wednesday we took steamer up the Rhine at six in the morning and landed at Mayence at eight It was a beautiful panorama but not surpassing all others I have seen The vine-clad hillsides the ruins of the old castles nothing like as many of them as I had thought and the winding of the river were all very lovely We visited the cathedral the monuments of Gutenberg and Schiller and then the fortress and the remains of a Roman monument erected nine years before Christ HEIDELBERG May 11 DEAR BROTHER D R As I clambered among the ruins of Heidelberg Castle today I wished for each of my loved ones to come across old ocean and look upon the remains of ancient civilization--of art and architecture bigotry and barbarism I am enjoying my flying though I would not again make such a rush but I am getting a good relish for a more deliberate tour at some later day All of life should not be given to ones work at home whether that be woman suffrage journalism or government affairs After being perpetually among people whose language I could not understand it was doubly grateful to be in the midst of not only my countrymen but my dearest friends and I enjoyed their society so much that I almost forgot there were any wonders to be seen in Berlin But we did make an excursion to Potsdam--a jolly company of us Mr and Mrs Sargent and their gifted daughter Ella also the professor of Greek in your Kansas State University Miss Kate Stephens She interpreted the utterances of the ever-present guides whose jabber was worse than Greek At Potsdam we were shown the very rooms in which Frederick the Great lived and moved and had his being plotted and planned to conquer his neighbors In the little church are myriads of tattered flags taken in their many wars and two great stone caskets in which repose the bodies of Frederick the Great and his father Frederick William peaceful in death however warlike in life We also visited the new palace where the present Emperor spends the summer We saw parlors dining-rooms bedrooms the plain narrow bedstead the Emperor sleeps upon the great workshop in which are maps and all sorts of material for studying and planning how to hold and gain empires I even peered into the kitchen and saw the pitchers plates coffee-pots and stew-pans It was my first chance of a real mortal living look of things so I enjoyed it hugely There are rooms enough in these palaces for an army of people All of these magnificent displays of wealth in churches palaces and castles citadels fortifications and glittering military shows of monarchial governments only make more conspicuous the poverty ignorance and degradation of the masses and all pleasure in seeing them is tinged with sadness From the diary for May 12--Showering but I walked up the mountain to pay a last visit to Heidelberg Castle the most magnificent ruin in Germany Its ivy-covered towers always will be pictured in my memory 13--At Strasburg We have driven over the city looked at the wonderful fortifications and explored the great cathedral with its famous clock We heard the grand organ and saw 250 priests conduct the services before an audience of 2000 people nine-tenths women Then to St Thomas church

I have not decided when I shall go home but before many months for I long to be about the work that remains undone The fact is I am weary of mere sight-seeing Amidst it all my head and heart turn to our battle for women at home Here in the old world with its despotic governments its utter blotting out of woman as an equal there is no hope no possibility of changing her condition so I look to our own land of equality for men and partial equality for women as the only one for hope or work PARIS May 24 MY DEAR RACHEL I am glad to hear that you were not cheated out of teetering through the palace halls in front of the princess and that you are not utterly prostrated by it I attended the suffrage meeting last evening and heard and saw several men speak--_well_ I inferred from the cheering and shouting of bravo! This afternoon I visited the tomb of Napoleon It surpasses every mausoleum I have ever seen not excepting that of Frederick the Third and Queen Louise in Berlin It is well that his memory should be thus honored for had he been born a hundred years later when the march of civilization had pointed to some other goal to gratify his great nature than that of bloody conquest of empire I believe he would have stood at the head of those who strive to make free and independent sovereigns of all men and all women Everywhere here are reminders of the ravages of war the madness of ignorance and unreason I want to get away from them and their saddening associations You will think I am blue So I am from having lived a purposeless life these three months I dont know but the women of America myself in particular will be the greater and grander for it but I can not yet see how this is to be LONDON June 7 MY DEAR SISTER For the hundredth time I am going to beg you to shut up the house and come over here It does seem as if now we two sisters left so alone ought to be able to travel and enjoy together You can not know how I long to have you with me it hurts every minute to think of you treading round and round with never a moment of leisure or enjoyment Surely you have given a mothers love and care to our nieces for eight years and now you can let them go out from under your eye Rachel and I came up from Basingstoke on Sunday to attend a small reception at Mrs Jacob Brights Her husband has championed woman suffrage in Parliament for years and she has led the few who have dared say And married women too should have the franchise When the powers that be forbade her to include married women in the Parliamentary Suffrage Bill now pending Mrs Bright withdrew and started a bill for their property rights which was passed last session and is now in force Illustration Autograph With kindest regards from Mr Bright and myself yours very truly Ursula M Bright Monday morning we went to Bedford Park and spent two hours at Moncure D Conways His charming wife read us what a delegate here from the American Unitarians says of Emerson Alcott Frothingham and George Ripley--that all are wearying of their early theories and theologies and returning to the old faith Today I had an hour with William Henry Channing and he virtually told me this was true of himself! I exclaimed Do you mean to say that you have returned to the belief in the immaculate conception of Jesus and in the miracles--that you no longer explain all these things as you used to do in your Bible readings at Rochester? He replied I never disbelieved in miracles Mans levelling and tunnelling the mountains is a miracle Well I was stunned and left Even if all these grand men in old age or when broken in body decide that the conclusions of their early and vigorous manhood were false which shall we accept as most likely to be true--the strong or the weakened thought? It is very disheartening if we are so constituted that with our deepest sincerest study we grope and dwell in error through our threescore and ten and after those allotted years find all we believed fact to be mere hallucination It is--it must be--simply the waning intellect returning to childish teachings That evening we visited the House of Commons and heard several members speak as we peeped through the wire latticework of the ladies cage The next afternoon we attended a large reception at Mrs J P Thomassons daughter of Margaret Bright Lucas and wife of a member of Parliament There we met the leading suffrage women Wednesday morning I went to Tunbridge Wells--thirty miles--to see Mrs Rose who is trying the waters there in hope of relief I should have told you that I dined on Sunday with Margaret Lucas--John Brights sister--and lunched today with Mrs Mellen mother-in-law of General Palmer of Colorado president of the Rio Grande R R--an elegant and wealthy woman LONDON June 22 MY DEAR SISTER Sunday morning we went to hear Stopford Brooke a seceder from the established church I could see no diminution in the poppings up and down nor in the intonings and singsongs but when after a full hour of the incantations he came to his sermon on the Christian duty of total abstinence he gave us a splendid one Before commencing he said that from his request the previous Sunday twenty members out of his congregation of 600 came to the meeting to form a Church Total Abstinence Society and ten of those made special and earnest protest against the formation of such a society! Can you imagine the chilliness of the spiritual air in that church as he laid down the Christians duty of denying himself that he might save his fellow who had not the power to drink moderately? Afterwards we called on Hon William D Kelley wife and daughter Florence of Philadelphia We also attended a reception at Emily Faithfulls and met a number of nice people then took underground railway for Bedford Park and had tea with Eliza Orme Englands first and only woman lawyer--or as nearly one as she can be and not have passed the Queens Bench Her mother was lovely and so proud of her daughter and glad to see me Miss Orme has a partner Miss Richardson who is a member of the London school board and has visited our schools in America She says London has none public or private to compare with those of the United States The next morning we went to hear Laura Curtis Bullard read her sketch of Mrs Stanton which is to go into Famous Women the same book for which Mrs Stanton is writing me up In the afternoon we called on Miss Müller who purchased a house and lives in it that she may be a householder as is necessary to hold office She too is a member of the school board Miss Müller insisted that I should talk to the ladies there about thirty of them and so I did sitting under the trees in her garden where we had our tea Thence we went to the womens suffrage parlors and met some fifty or sixty and then to the Albemarle Club of both ladies and gentlemen the only one of the kind in London Then came a meeting at the Somerville Club--all ladies A paper was read on the topic Sentiment is not founded on reason and is a hindrance to progress and followed by a bright discussion in which both Rachel and I were invited to take part A pretty full afternoon and evening! Wednesday morning I studied on my speech for the 25th under the auspices of the National Womens Suffrage Society Harriot has so divided the subject that Mrs Stanton is to take the educational social and religious departments and S B A the industrial legal and political That evening we went to the Court Theater with Mrs Florence Fenwick Miller another member of the London school board The nights are all days here now--daylight till after 9 oclock and again at 3 Rachel and I lunched with Mr and Mrs Jacob Bright and had a splendid visit then went to the school board meeting Illustration Priscilla Bright McLaren Signed Your loving friend Priscilla Bright McLaren Illustration Autograph Cordially yours Helen Taylor Saw there five of the seven women members among them Miss Helen Taylor stepdaughter of John Stuart Mill and the senior woman member of the board Today I spent an hour with Mrs Lucas sister of John and Jacob Bright and this afternoon Rachel and I are going to a Womens Poor Law Guardian meeting at which Mrs Lucas is to preside and other ladies to speak Just back from the meeting In all England there are thirty-one women poor law guardians There are 19000 of the guardians elected and 1000 mainly clergymen are honorary They have over 1000000 paupers to look after The secretary Mrs Chamberlain stated that in her section of London there were 16000 The guardians overlook everything about the workhouses and asylums get no pay and yet the public hesitates to put women on the board One man stirred up the handful present by saying suffrage not only for widows and spinsters but for married women June 26--Well the ordeal is over and everybody is delighted Moncure D Conway said I have learned more of American history from your speech than I ever dreamed had been made during the past thirty years Even the timid ones expressed great satisfaction Mrs Stanton gave them the rankest radical sentiments but all so cushioned they didnt hurt Mrs Duncan McLaren came down from Edinburgh and Mrs Margaret Parker from Dundee Rachel said I made a good statement of the industrial legal and political status of women in America We went to tea with Mrs Jacob Bright then I took dinner with Mrs Stanton at Mrs Mellens getting up from table at 915 P M Illustration Autograph Most sincerely yours Jane Cobden Saturday Rachel and I drove four hours in Miss Müllers carriage and called on Lady Wilde a bright quaint woman Sunday morning I went to Friends meeting and had a look at John Bright though I was not sure it was he until after the meeting was over then he was gone and I not introduced to him! In the afternoon I called on Miss Jane Cobden daughter of Richard Cobden a charming woman Yesterday I presented her with a set of our History in memory of her noble father and for her own sake also I will not foreshadow the coming days but they are busy indeed You will see that the Central Committee have put both my name and Mrs Stantons on the card for the meeting of July 5 LONDON June 28 MY DEAR SISTER It is now just after luncheon and at 4 oclock we are to be at Mrs Jacob Brights reception tomorrow evening at one at Mrs Thomassons which she gives to friends for the special purpose of meeting Stanton and Anthony and Saturday at Frances Power Cobbes--and so we go Yesterday morning Miss Frances Lord--a poor law guardian--escorted us through Lambeth workhouse It has 1000 inmates and 700 more in the infirmary and gives out-door relief to 2000 besides Jacob Bright presided over the Princes Hall meeting and William Woodall over that at St James Hall17 All of the prominent newspapers in Great Britain contained editorials on the meetings and noted especially the addresses of Miss Anthony and Mrs Stanton speaking of them in a dignified and respectful manner LONDON July 13 MY DEAR SISTER My last letter was mailed the 3d That afternoon I was at Rebecca Moores reception We dined at Miss Müllers and afterwards went to Horns assembly rooms to a suffrage meeting Her sister Eva wife of Walter McLaren MP was one of the speakers At 9 P M we went to a Fourth of July reception at Mrs Mellens given in honor of Mrs Stanton and Miss Anthony and a brilliant affair it was About 150 were there she had elegant refreshments and the young American girls gave songs recitations violin music etc Grace Greenwood recited her Mistress ORafferty--a womans rights poem in Irish brogue--very rich and racy her daughter Annie sang also Mrs Carpenter of Chicago Kate Hillard of Brooklyn Adelaide Detchon the actress and Mildred Conway recited Frank Lincoln impersonated Nathaniel Mellen sang a negro jubilee melody Maude Powell played the violin She is not fifteen yet and is a charming player The company did not disperse until after one July 5 drove to Mrs Mellens to a 10 oclock breakfast and worked on Rachels report of my Princes Hall speech--youll find it in full in the Englishwomans Review In the evening Mrs Thomasson gave a splendid dinner-party and afterwards took us all in carriages to the St James Hall suffrage demonstration where there was a fine audience of about 2000 Next morning I went to a meeting of the suffrage friends from various towns who had come up for the demonstration At 8 P M Mrs McLaren took me to the House of Commons to witness Mr Hugh Mason present the Womens Suffrage Bill so I heard all the speeches pro and con up to 130 A M and how tired I was! Mr Jacob Brights was the strongest and most earnest The morning of July 7 at the suffrage rooms I heard strong protests against the way Mr Mason disclaimed all intention of enfranchising married women He carried the matter too far even for the most timid In the afternoon we went to the Somerville Club and Rachel spoke beautifully on the need of union and co-operation among women I followed her and Mrs McLaren moved a vote of thanks Rachel left for Antwerp this evening to meet her mother and sister and I returned to my room lonesome enough Sunday I lunched with Mrs Lucas and Mrs McLaren I had calls from three factory-women who told a sad story of the impossibility of getting even a dollar ahead by the most frugal and temperate habits Have I told you that I have a new dark garnet velvet? I wore it with my point lace at Mrs Mellens reception on the Fourth and the India shawl I have worn today for the first time Tuesday I went with Mrs Lucas to the Crystal Palace at Sydenham to a great national temperance demonstration More than 50000 people passed the gates at a shilling apiece and we saw a solid mass of 5000 boys and girls from all parts of the kingdom seated in a huge amphitheater singing temperance songs--a beautiful sight Then in another part of the palace was an audience of 2000 listening to speeches Among the speakers was Canon Wilberforce a grandson of the great Abolitionist but a degenerate one He said the reason the temperance movement was now progressing so rapidly was because the persons who led it were praying people and that the Lord had willed it and all depended on whether it was kept in the Lords hands--if not then it would fall back like the old Washingtonian movement in America Mrs Lucas was very wroth and so was I He never spoke of woman except as maiden aunt or old grandmother and advised the boys to take a little wine for the stomachs sake At 6 oclock we went to Miss Müllers where I remained until today She took me to the Gaiety Theater to see Sarah Bernhardt What a magnificent actor! I never saw any man or woman who so absolutely buried self out of sight and became the very being personated Though I couldnt understand a single word I enjoyed it all until the curtain fell at half-past eleven I was tired beyond telling but felt richly repaid by the seeing She must be master of her divine art thus to impress one by action alone Today Mrs McLaren invites me to dine at her sons Charles McLaren MP All this is written in a hurry but is perhaps better than nothing It is so difficult to clutch a moment to write LONDON July 19 MY DEAR RACHEL I am to attend a suffrage meeting at the Westminster Palace Hotel Hall this afternoon and tomorrow at 1025 A M I start for Edinburgh with Mrs Moore I am bound to suck all the honey possible out of everybody and everything as they come to me or I go to them It is such unwisdom such unhappiness not to look for and think and talk of the best in all things and all people so you see at threescore and three I am still trying always to keep the bright and right side up I am expecting a great ferment at the meeting today for those who agree with Mrs Jacob Bright have asked Mrs Stanton to confer with them about what they shall do now She advises them to demand suffrage for all women married and single but I contend that it is not in good taste for either of us to counsel public opposition to the bill before Parliament I wrote you about Miss ---- She is settled in the conviction that she never will marry any man--not even the one with whom she has had so close a friendship for the past ten years She feels that to do the work for the world which she has mapped out she must eschew marriage accepting platonic friendship but no more I tell her she is giving her nature a severe trial by allowing herself this one particular friend that if he does not in the end succeed in getting her to marry him it will be the first escape I ever have heard of She is a charming earnest conscientious woman and I feel deeply interested in her experiment After being royally entertained in London and making many little trips into the beautiful country around Miss Anthony left for Edinburgh July 20 carrying with her many pleasant remembrances of friends EDINBURGH July 22 MY DEAR SISTER Here I am in Huntley Lodge the delightful home of Mrs Elizabeth Pease Nichol whose name we so often used to see in the Liberator and the Anti-Slavery Standard and of whom we used to hear from Mr Phillips and others who had visited England We had a most cordial welcome from Mrs Nichol--a queenly woman She is now seventy-seven and lives in this handsome house two miles from the center of the city with only her servants Mrs Nichol has gone to her room to rest and Mrs Moore and I are writing in the little sunny southeast parlor I have an elegant suite of three rooms the same Mr Garrison occupied when he visited here in 1867 and in 1877 Mrs Nichol is one of the few left of that historic Worlds Anti-Slavery Convention of 1840 We are going to a substantial tea with Dr Agnes McLaren daughter of Duncan McLaren She is very bright--spent four years in France studying her profession--has a good practice takes a house by herself and invites to it her friends So many young Englishwomen are doing this and indeed it is a good thing for single women to do The suffrage society--Eliza Wigham president Jessie M Wellstood secretary--has invited a hundred or more of the friends to an afternoon tea on Tuesday next in honor of my visit and I am to make a brief speech so what to say and how to say it come uppermost with me again Illustration Elizabeth Pease Nichol Signed Elizabeth Pease Nichol THE RAVEN HOTEL DROITWICH August 5 MY DEAR FRIEND SUSAN B ANTHONY I have often wished to write thee since we parted in London my heart has been so full of loving thought It has been a greater trial than I can describe that I have been denied the pleasure of receiving thee in my home in Edinburgh If it had been only for an hour I should have looked back on that hour as one of great privilege But even if we should not meet again I have had a pleasure which seems almost like a dream to me in having made the personal acquaintance of thyself and dear Mrs Stanton That thou shouldst have been on the 1st of August with the Elizabeth Pease of those grand anti-slavery times revived in me the thought I expressed in moving a vote of thanks to thee and Mrs Cady Stanton for the noble addresses you gave at the Princes Hall Meeting in London that you had been brought here to give us the hand of rejoicing fellowship and that it gave me great faith to believe the God of Justice was leading us on and had brought England and America together by your presence amongst us at this most critical and hopeful time of our agitation I have addressed thee in the dear singular person because it seemed to me in harmony with the noble simplicity of thy character and also more affectionate--just as I feel toward thee Believe me dear friend--I love so to call thee--thine very affectionately PRISCILLA BRIGHT MCLAREN The diary notes many teas and luncheons in Edinburgh drives to Melrose Abbey Holyrood Palace Roslyn Castle to the celebrated monuments the old cathedrals and the university calls from distinguished professors and those interested in philanthropic movements visits to public institutions and lovely gifts from the new friends Every day of the month was filled with pleasant incidents The scenery through the lake and mountain regions Miss Anthony found so beautiful that although there was a steady downpour of rain for days she sat on the outside of boat or stage in order not to miss a moment of it She hunted up the old home of Thomas Clarkson but could not find there a person who ever had heard of him She went also to the Friends meeting house at Ulverston presented to the Society by George Fox and completed in 1688 To her such spots as these were more interesting and hallowed than towering castles and vine-clad abbeys BALLACHULISH HOTEL August 13 MY DEAR SISTER Miss Julia Osgood and I are here waiting for sunshine While in Edinburgh Mrs Nichol drove us out to Craigmillar Castle where I saw the very rooms in which Queen Mary lived We bought for a shilling a basket of strawberries plucked--no pulled--the old man who sold them said from the very garden in which berries and vegetables were pulled for Queen Mary three hundred years ago One evening Professor Blackie of the Edinburgh University dined with Mrs Nichol At my reception he had said he did not want to see refined delicate women going down into the muddy pool of politics and I asked him if he had ever thought that since the only places which were too filthy for women were those where men alone went perhaps they might be so from lack of women At dinner Mrs Nichol rallied him on the report that he had been converted and he admitted that it was true so as he was leaving I said Then I am to reckon an Edinboro professor among my converts? He seized my hand and kissed it saying Ill seal it with a kiss Dont be alarmed--he is fully eighty years of age but blithe and frolicsome--sang and acted out a Scotch war-song in the real Gaelic On August 1 we saw 200 medical students capped--and not a woman among them because the powers ruled that none should be admitted That afternoon we called on Professor Masson a great champion of co-education We took tea with Mrs Jane and Miss Eliza Wigham The stepmother now eighty-two was Jane Smeale in 1840 In their house have visited Henry C Wright Parker Pillsbury and of course Mr Garrison Mrs Nichol went with us to Melrose by rail from which we drove to Abbotsford Tuesday at 2 oclock Miss Osgood and I landed at Stirling At 430 we reached Callander where I found no trunk and not a man of them could give a guess as to its whereabouts They give you no check here but just stick a patch on your trunk I had expected not to find it at every stop and now it was gone for sure but the station-master was certain he could find it and forward it to me so he wrote out its description and telegraphed in every direction Meanwhile we went to a hotel for luncheon and there in the hall was my trunk! Nobody knew why or how it got there and all acknowledged our American check system superior I was raging at their stupidity and no system at all but laughingly said You ought to send this trunk free a thousand miles to pay for my big scold at you The man good-naturedly replied Where will you have it sent? I answered Oban and he booked it At 6 oclock we took the front seat with the driver on a great high stage which we mounted by a ladder--they call the stage the machine--and drove a few miles to the Trossachs Hotel past Loch Achray and Loch Vennachar While the rain rested this noon I took a walk up the ravine and it seemed very like going up the mountain at Grandfather Anthonys Indeed there is nothing here more beautiful than we have in America only everything has some historic or poetic association BRUNTSFIELD LODGE WHITEHOUSE LOAN EDINBURGH August 23 MY DEAR SISTER Here am I back in Edinboro again at Dr Jex-Blakes delightful home--at least one hundred and fifty years old with an acre or more of garden all enclosed with a six-foot wall Lodge means a walled-in house loan means lane and the street took its name from a white house which two hundred and fifty years ago stood in this road Every day the doctor has taken me a long and beautiful ride in her basket-carriage driving her own little pony White Angel or her hay horse while her boy-groom rides in his perch behind Today she drove me through Lord Roseberys park of thousands of acres It is lovely as a native forest--the roads macadamized all through--and a palace-like residence set deep within AMBLESIDE August 27 MY DEAR SISTER Last Thursday I left Edinburgh for Penrith which has a fine view of the lake and the hills beyond Next morning I took steamer at Pooley Bridge The trip the whole length of the lake was beautiful but can not compare with Lake George--indeed nothing I have seen equals that--but the hills mountains they call them here the water and the sky all were lovely At Patterdale I had a cup of tea with bread and butter and the veritable orange marmalade manufactured at Dundee Thence I took a stage over Kirkstone Pass and walked two miles up the hills to a small hotel with a signboard saying it is the highest inhabited house in England 1114 feet above the sea--not very much beside Denvers 6000 and others in Colorado 10000 or 12000 Arrived at Ambleside to find the hotel overflowing so they sent me to a farmers house where I had a good bed splendid milk and sweet butter Saturday morning I went by coach to Coniston then railway to Furness Abbey a seven-hundred-year-old ruin of magnificent proportions After four hours there I took a train to Lakeside and then steamer up Lake Windermere back to Ambleside The hotel still being full the Boots as they call the porter or runner found me lodgings at a private house where I am now It is the tiniest little stone cottage but they have a cow so I am in clover My breakfasts consist of a bit of ham cured by the hostess a boiled egg white and graham bread with butter and currant jam and a cup of tea Saturday evening I strolled out and entered the gate of Harriet Martineaus home On the terrace I met the present occupants Mr and Mrs William Henry Hills They invited me to call in the morning when they would be happy to show me over the house In naming the hour they said We never go to church--we are Liberal Friends--_real_ Friends At that I immediately felt at home with them I called and spent two hours sitting and chatting in the drawing-room where Harriet Martineau received her many distinguished guests and in the kitchen saw the very same table chairs and range which were there when she died and sitting on the doorsill was the same black-and-yellow cat said to be fourteen years old now The Hills invited me to 5 oclock tea which we took in the library where Miss Martineau used to sit and study as well as entertain her guests at dinner It seemed impossible to realize that I was actually in her house It is not large and is covered with ivy which grows most luxuriantly everywhere It fronts on a large field much lower than the knoll on which it stands and fine hills stretch off beyond The old gardener who has been here more than thirty years still lives in a little stone cottage just under the terrace Illustration Autograph Yours affectionately H Martineau Mr Hills is a great lover of America and its institutions He is one of the very few I have met here who really love republicanism Nearly every one clings to the caste and class principle thinks the world can not exist if a portion of the people are not doomed to be servants and that for the poor to have an ambition to rise and become something more than their parents makes them discontented Yes I answer and that is just what I want them to be because it is only through a wholesome discontent with things as they are that we ever try to make them any better DUBLIN September 10 MY DEAR SISTER I stayed in Belfast some days and visited the Giants Causeway with Miss Isabella Tod amidst sunshine and drenching showers still it was a splendid sight fully equal to Fingals Cave The day before we went nearly one hundred miles into the country to a village where she spoke at a temperance meeting Here we were guests of the Presbyterian minister--a cousin of Joseph Medill of the Chicago Tribune--and a cordial greeting he and his bright wife gave me They have three Presbyterian churches in that one little village All welcomed the woman speaker most kindly but not a person could be urged to vote down the whiskey shops as these are licensed by a justice of the peace appointed by the Lord Chancellor of Ireland who receives his appointment from the Queen of England! Illustration Autograph Yours most truly Isabella M S Tod So all she could ask was that every one should become a total abstainer I do not see how they can submit to be thus voiceless as to their own home regulations Saturday I took tea with Mrs Haslam a bright lovely come-outer from the Friends She had invited some twenty or thirty to be present at eight and I spoke they asking questions and I answering Among them were a son of the Abolitionist Richard D Webb and ever so many nephews and nieces Eliza Wighams brother Henry and his wife had come ten miles to be there This afternoon I am going to the common council meeting with Alfred Webb who is a member and a strong Home Ruler The question of electing their own tax collector is to be discussed CORK September 16 MY DEAR SISTER Your heart would break if you were here to see the poverty and rags and yet the people seem cheerful under it all Something surely must be wrong at the root to bear such fruit I have had an awfully hard side of a board time of ten hours in a third-class car paying therefor just as much as I would on the N Y Central for a first-class ticket I not only saved 425 by going third-class but I saw the natives Men women boys and girls who had been to the market towns with their produce were on the train and to see them as they tumbled in toward evening at town after town one would think that whiskey and tobacco were the main articles they bought Any number of men and boys and at least four women were drunk enough and they brought bottles with them and added to their puling idiocy as they went on Nothing short of a pig-sty could match the filth but it is only in that class of cars that you see anything of the vast number of poor farmers and laborers If they can not pay exorbitant rates refined educated men and women are thrust into pens and seated face to face with the smoking drinking carousing rabble I have everywhere protested against this outrage and urged the women to demand that the railway companies should give them separate cars with no smoking allowed LEAMINGTON October 1 MY DEAR RACHEL I must have told you of my good times at Belfast with Miss Tod who gave a reception for me and I had a welcome all round Miss Osgood met me at Cork and we went by rail to Macroom Tuesday morning we visited the convent nuns schools and the poorhouse with 400 helpless mortals old and young then took an Irish jaunting-car and were driven some forty miles through the Gap to Glengariff It rained almost all the way much to our disgust Next morning we packed into two great stages with thirty or more others and started for the lakes of Killarney but soon the rain poured again and as we were losing so much of the scenery we stopped half-way at Kenmare We visited the convent and the Mother Abbess showed us every cranny Thirty girls were at work on beautiful Irish point and Limerick lace These nuns have 400 pupils and give 200 of the poorest their breakfast and lunch--porridge and a bit of bread At two we took stage again the sky looked promising but alas! for half an hour it fairly poured Then it grew lighter and we got very fine views of hills and dales Killarneyis_ lovely Saturday I sauntered along the streets of Killarney passed the market and saw all sorts of poor humanity coming in with their cattle to sell or to buy Many rode in two-wheeled carts without seat or spring drawn by little donkeys and nearly all the women and girls were bareheaded and barefooted On the bridge I saw some boys looking down I looked too and there was a spectacle--a ragged bareheaded barefooted woman tossing a wee baby over her shoulders and trying to get her apron switched around to hold it fast on her back I heard her say to herself Ill niver do it so I said Boys one of you run down there and help her At that instant she succeeded in getting the baby adjusted and to my horror took up a bundle from the grass and disclosed a second baby! ThenI_ went down I learned that she had just come from the poorhouse where she had spent six weeks and before going further had laid her two three-weeks-old boys on the cold wet grass while she washed out their clothes in the stream The clothing was the merest rags all scrambled up in a damp bundle She had heard her old mother was ill in Milltown and had fretted about her till she could bear it no longer so had started to walk ten miles to her I hailed a boy with a jaunting-car--told her to wait and I would take her home--got my luncheon--fed the boys horse bought lunch for boy and woman--and off we went she sitting on one side of the car with her two babies wet bundle two milk bottles and rubber appendages bare feet and flying hair and I on the other with the boy in front For a long way both babies cried they were blue as pigeons and had on nothing but little calico slips no socks even She had four children older than these--a husband who went to fairs selling papers and anything he could to support them all--and an aged father and mother who lived with them She said if God had given her only one child she could still help earn something to live on but now He had given her two she couldnt When we reached Milltown I followed her home It was in a long row of one-room things with a door--but no window Some peat was smouldering under a hole in the roof called a chimney and the place was thick with smoke On the floor in one corner was some straw with a blanket on it which she said was her bed in another were some boards fastened into bed-shape with straw packed in and this belonged to her father and mother Where the four other children with the chickens and the pig found their places to sleep I couldnt see I went to the home of another tenant and there again was one room and sitting around a pile of smoking-hot potatoes on the cold wet ground--not a board or even a flag-stone for a floor--were six ragged dirty children Not a knife fork spoon or platter was to be seen The man was out working for a farmer his wife said and the evidences were that God was about to add a No 7 to her flock What a dreadful creature their God must be to keep sending hungry mouths while he withholds the bread to fill them! I went back to Killarney heart-sick wrote letters Sunday and Monday took train for Limerick where I rushed round for an hour or two Then went on to Galway Tuesday morning took the mail-car to Connemara and had company all the way--a judge an Irish MP and two Dublin drummers--with whom I talked over the Irish problem I had meant to make the tour of the western coast up to Londonderry but my courage failed It was to be the same soul-sickening sight all the way--only I was assured worse than anything yet seen I took the stage back to Galway every one saying it was sure to be a fine day but it proved to be terrific wind and rain and before I had gone ten miles my seat was a pool of water and it took all my skill to keep my umbrella right side out Once while the driver changed horses I stood in front of a big fire on the hearth of the best farmers house I have seen here Everything was clean and cheerful--two rooms--a bed made up with a spotless white spread--the old father smoking and the wife cooking dinner She lifted a wooden cover from a jar and proudly showed me her butter--patted down with her hands I could see--and near by was another jar with milk Think of butter being made in a room full of tobacco-smoke! Then I went my last ten out of the fifty miles having been soaking wet for eight hours At my hotel I had room and fire on a double-quick bath-tub and hot water and put myself through a regular grooming In the morning I rode around Galway saw Queens College and the bay and then took train for Belfast From the diary Sept 11--In Dublin The Professor of Arabic took me through Trinity College with its library of 200000 volumes Thence to the old Parliament House now the Bank of Ireland In the afternoon Alfred Webb went with me to the National League rooms and from there to Thomas Webbs for tea where I saw the names of Garrison and N P Rogers written in 1840 We called on Michael Davitt the leader of the Irish Land League who impressed me as an earnest honest man deeply-rooted in the principles of freedom and equality and claiming all for woman that he does for man Sept 16--At Youghal Visited the home of Sir Walter Raleigh Lady Hennessy eighty years old showing me around Found in a library Children of the Abbey and read again the story of Lord Mortimer and Amanda Once it thrilled my young soul but now it seems inexpressibly thin Sept 20--While I was talking in the car today with an Irishwoman about the poverty here another behind me shouted It is very ill manners for an American to come over here and abuse the English government Sept 29--In Belfast O how I would like to purchaseall_ the linen I want for myself and my friends! Have bought as much as I dared and after all perhaps Im cheated--but its done so I wont worry Sept 30--Landed at Fleetwood and went direct to Rugby Walked all around the famous school but had not courage to go in and introduce myself to Doctor Jex-Blake whose sisters guest I had so recently been Oct 1--At Leamington Went direct to Kenilworth Castle a grand old ruin the home of Leicester where Queen Elizabeth visited him in the olden days Oct 2--Mrs Mullinor called at our hotel and accompanied us to Warwick Castle a splendid pile We lunched with her and when Mr M put fork into the roast he remarked Wife asked me what she should order for dinner and I said a leg of mutton for Americans never see such a thing at home We smiled and ate it with a relish Oct 3--At Stratford on Avon and we have visited every spot sacred to the memory of Shakespeare and walked through the meadows and down by the riverside Oct 4--In Oxford I have visited many of the colleges and as I saw where all the millions of dollars had been expended for the education of boys alone I groaned in spirit and betook me to Somerville and St Margarets Halls where at least there is a shelter for girls and a beginning Oct 5--In London and how almost like getting home it seems to come back here LONDON October 7 MY DEAR SISTER Mrs Stanton feels that she must stay with Hattie till the baby is a month old and then have a week for farewell visits in London Cousins Fannie and Charles Dickinson are here Today I learned that I should have a chance to see and hear John Bright at a convention of the Liberal Party at Leeds October 17 all these together have made me put off leaving a little longer Since yesterday we have been in the midst of a genuine London fog It is now 10 A M and even darker than it was two hours ago when we dressed and breakfasted by gaslight I saw smoky foggy days here last March but they could not compare with this and yet the people say O this is nothing to what November will bring LONDON October 27 MY DEAR SISTER Since I last wrote you I have visited Leeds where I was the guest of Mrs Hannah Ford who has an elegant home--Adel Grange There were several other guests who had come to attend the great Liberal demonstration among them Mrs Margaret Priestman Tanner a sister-in-law of John Bright and his son Albert Mrs Alice Scatcherd of Leeds was the person who had the sagacity to get women sent as delegates and secure them admission on terms of perfect equality The amendment was a great triumph She invited the friends to meet next day at her house where I saw John Brights daughter Mrs Helen Clark and Richard Cobdens Miss Jane Cobden Both made speeches at the convention and most fitting it was they should--the daughters of the two leading Radicals of a half century ago On Saturday Mrs Ford took me to Haworth the home of the Brontë sisters It is a bleak enough place now and must have been even more so forty or fifty years ago when those sensitive plants lived there A most sad day it was to me as I looked into the little parlor where the sisters walked up and down with their arms around each other and planned their novels or sat before the fireplace and built air-castles Then there were the mouldering tombstones of the graveyard which lies in front and at one side of the house and the old church-pew directly over the vault where lay their loved mother and two sisters And later when Emily and Anne and the erring brother Branwell had joined the others poor Charlotte sat there alone The pew had to be removed every time the vault was opened to receive another occupant Think of those delicate women sitting in that fireless mouldy church listening to their old fathers dry hard theology with their feet on the cold carpetless stones which covered their loved dead It was too horrible! Then I walked over the single stone pathway through the fields toward the moor opened the same wooden gates and was and still continue to be dipped into the depths of their utter loneliness and sadness born so out of time and place How much the world of literature has lost because of their short and ill-environed lives we can guess only from its increased wealth in spite of all their adverse conditions From Leeds I went to Birmingham to attend an Anti-Contagious Diseases Acts conference and there heard the serene lovely Josephine E Butler Illustration Autograph Josephine E Butler Miss Müller has invited Mrs Stanton and me to spend the rest of our time with her Mrs Lucas and some others are going to Liverpool to say good-by to us The cordiality instead of decreasing grows greater and greater as the day of departure draws near I dread stepping on shipboard but long to set foot upon my native soil again Only think I shall have been gone over nine months when I land in New York! From the diary Oct 13--Last evening at Mrs Roses I met the daughter of Charles Bradlaugh a talented young woman whom the college refused to admit to botany lectures because of her fathers atheism Oct 18--At Leeds Liberal party convention went this evening to hear John Bright remember to forget to mention the extension of suffrage to women in 1869 and 1870 and the property law for married women in 1882 He did not meet my expectations as a speaker but far surpasses any other Englishman I have heard None of them can touch Wendell Phillips Oct 28--Had a four hours row on the Thames today with some friends This evening went to hear Mrs Annie Besant Nov 2--Have been out to Basingstoke to see the new baby Mrs Mona Caird lunched with us Have heard Michael Davitt Mr Fawcett and Helen Taylor all masterly speakers Illustration Autograph Sincerely Yours Frances Power Cobbe LONDON November 6 MY DEAR SISTER As soon as I finish this scribble I am to have 5 oclock tea with Frances Power Cobbe Tomorrow I go shopping Thursday Millicent Garrett Fawcett is to dine with us and Mrs Peter Taylor is to call here and all are to take substantial tea with dear noble Mrs Lucas and then go to hear

sisters-in-law of John Bright who give a reception in my honor The 12th I visit Margaret E Parker at Warrington and the next afternoon Mrs Stanton and I both go to Alderley Edge near Manchester to the home of Mr and Mrs Jacob Bright18 On the 14th we attend the annual meeting of the Manchester Womens Suffrage Association and on the 16th go to Liverpool where a reception will be given us in the afternoon That evening we shall spend at our hotel with the friends who go to see us off and on the 17th we give ourselves to old oceans care in the Cunarder Servia Illustration Autograph Believe me yours very truly M G Fawcett Dont worry now if you do not hear from me again until I touch Yankee soil and dont worry if the wind blows or if you learn the vessel is late or lost If the Servia fail to land me safe and sound dont repine or stop because I am not but buckle on a new and stronger harness and do double work for the good cause of woman You have the best of judgment in our work and are capable of doing much if only you had confidence in yourself so whatever comes to me do you be all the more for the less thatI_ am Half of Miss Anthonys nine-months trip abroad had been spent in Great Britain To her all the other attractions of the old world were as nothing compared with its living breathing humanity On the continent she was deprived of any exchange of thought with its people because she spoke no language but her own and this made her prefer England but there was another and a stronger interest--the great progressive movement which was going forward in regard to woman Here she found women of fine intellect and high social position engaged in the same work to which she had given more than thirty years of her own life and here she met sympathy and recognition which would have been impossible in any other country in Europe Her central thought in going to Great Britain had been to secure the co-operation of Englishwomen in holding an international suffrage convention At first her proposition met with no response The most radical of English women were conservative compared to those of America but after they had become thoroughly acquainted with Mrs Stanton and herself and prejudice had been supplanted by confidence the idea began to be more favorably regarded One serious difficulty in the way of the proposed convention lay in the fact that the suffrage women of England and Scotland were not themselves in thorough unison as to plans and purposes No definite action was taken until the last afternoon of their stay when at the reception given in their honor by Dr Ewing Whittle in Liverpool with the hearty concurrence of Mrs McLaren Mrs Lucas Mrs Scatcherd and Mrs Parker who had accompanied Miss Anthony and Mrs Stanton to see them safely on board their vessel a strong committee was formed to promote international organization Illustration Margaret Bright Lucas Signed Yours affectionately Margaret Bright Lucas They sailed from Liverpool on the Servia November 17 1883 Among their fellow voyagers were Mrs Cornelia C Hussey of Orange N J to whom the cause of woman suffrage and Miss Anthony personally are deeply indebted and Mrs Margaret B Sullivan of Chicago the distinguished editorial writer There was some lovely weather which was greatly enjoyed but heavy fogs impeded the ship and it was just ten days from the time of starting when on November 27 they steamed into New York harbor and stepped again on the shores of loved America FOOTNOTES 14 The many inquiries and directions in regard to the suffrage work and the loving messages to friends and relatives at home are omitted in the extracts made from Miss Anthonys letters but they are of constant occurrence and show that these were never absent from her thoughts 15 While in Florence Miss Anthony was entertained by the Countess de Resse daughter of Elizabeth B Phelps of New York and by the Princess Koltzoff-Massalsky the distinguished author and artist known through Europe by her pen-name of Dora dIstria 16 Miss Anthony occupied some rainy days while here in wrapping up papers and writing letters which she put in her official envelopes bearing the revolutionary mottoes No just government can be formed without the consent of the governed Taxation without representation is tyranny After a few days a dignified official appeared at the American legation with a large package of mail bearing the proscribed mottoes and said Such sentiments can not pass through the post-office in Germany So in modest uncomplaining wraps the letters and papers started again for the land of the free--E C S 17 WOMENS SUFFRAGE A Public Meeting will be held in ST JAMES HALL PICCADILLY Thursday July 5th 1883 In Support of the Resolution to be moved by Mr Mason in the House of Commons on July 6th

afterwards from Mrs Bright in which she made this playful reference to Miss Anthonys always depreciating herself in favor of Mrs Stanton We have thought of you often and hoped that the wind which has been rough here has been tempered on the Atlantic for your sakes Apropos of the very beautiful allusion you made to Mrs Cady Stantons popularity and the effect produced by her personal appearance I must tell you of a remark made by my little son John immediately after your departure I found him sitting on the sofa in my bedroom thinking deeply Mamma he said I wish you could get me a photograph of Miss Anthony I think she has such a fine face There is something about it so firm and yet so kind I said Do you like her better than Mrs Stanton? Oh dear yes much better replied Johnnie So you see she does not monopolize all the admiration! CHAPTER XXXIII CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS--VISIT TO NEW ORLEANS 1884-1885 Most of the newspapers had a welcome for Miss Anthony In a two-column report in the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle she is quoted as saying I can scarcely tell you of the hospitality extended the dinners teas and receptions given in our honor I had no idea we were so well-known in Great Britain or that there was such cordial feeling toward us Of course I met chiefly those known as Liberals and the sympathizers with our cause Public sentiment there is rapidly growing in our favor In the discussion I heard in Parliament not a Conservative uttered a word against the suffrage already possessed by women but relied upon the hackneyed argument that when married women were included there would be trouble You saw the Queen I suppose? No I thought more of seeing the Bright family than the Queen and I never happened to be near where she was I really had very little leisure to look around I am ashamed to say I did not visit Westminster until the morning before I came away but it was simply for lack of time The social idea was of more importance to me The New York Evening Telegram said editorially The statement of Miss Susan B Anthony in another column illustrates the superb determination of that champion of womans political rights In the struggle which has constituted her life-work she has the rare advantage of not being able to comprehend defeat Battling under the inspiration of an enthusiast--of a fanatic some may be disposed to say--she knows no such word as fail The most disheartening reverses appear to her inspired imagination but steps in an undeviating march of progress It was enthusiasm such as this that made the career of Joan of Arc Without it not even the broad intellect and strong soul of Miss Anthony could sustain the burden of the struggle which she is called upon to lead The Washington correspondent of the Cleveland Leader thus began a long interview Susan B Anthony is back from Europe and is here for the winters fight in behalf of woman suffrage She seems remarkably well and has gained fifteen pounds since she left last spring She is sixty-three but looks just the same as twenty years ago There is perhaps an extra wrinkle in her face a little more silver in her hair but her blue eyes are just as bright her mouth as serious and her step as active as when she was forty She would attract attention in any crowd She is of medium height and medium form but her face is wonderfully intellectual and she moves about like the woman of a purpose that she is She says she experiences far different treatment by public men now from what she did years ago The statesman of the past always came to her with a smirk on his face as though he considered womans rights nonsensical and thought himself wonderfully condescending to take notice of her at all Now says she public men look upon our mission as a matter of business and we are considered from that standpoint The interview closed One question more Miss Anthony Will you please tell me what is your highest ideal of the woman of the future? It is hard to say was the reply The woman of the future will far surpass the one of the present even as the man of the future will surpass the one of today The ages are progressive and I look for a far higher manhood and womanhood than we now have I think this will come through making the sexes co-equal When women associate with men in serious matters as they do now in frivolous both will grow stronger and the worlds work will be better done I look for the day when the woman who has a political or judicial brain will have as much right to sit in the Senate or on the Supreme Bench as men have when women will have equal property business and political rights with men when the only criterion of excellence or position shall be the ability and character of the individual and this time will come All of the Western colleges are now open to women and send forth more than 2000 women graduates every year Think of the effect upon the race to come! The woman of the future will be a better wife mother and citizen than the woman of today There were however some discordant notes in the symphony of pleasant things which by 1883 had become customary in the newspapers For instance the Cincinnati Times-Star headed its interview Susan Speaks--Miss Anthony Corralled by a Times-Star Correspondent--The Old Lady Wears Good Clothes and Stops at First-class Hotels--Bubbling about the Ballot The smart reporter described the size of her foot devoted a paragraph to the question whether her teeth were natural or artificial and said There must be money in being a reformer for Miss Anthony lives at the Riggs House in good style and expects to be there all winter and this after a summer in Europe would be a pretty severe drain on any but a long purse When one thinks of Miss Anthonys uniform kindness and courtesy to reporters always granting an interview no matter how tired or how busy she might be and assisting them in every possible way with information and suggestions it is astonishing that any one of them could indulge in petty personal criticism and innuendoes Miss Anthony had now another friend at court Col Halbert S Greenleaf of Rochester having been elected to Congress Both he and his wife were strong and influential advocates of suffrage and her warm personal friends The diary shows that every day of December she was conferring with officials and their wives who were friendly to the cause making converts wherever possible and co-operating actively with the District committee in all the drudgery of detail necessary to a successful convention It is only by reading her diary that one can understand what a mental agony it was for Miss Anthony to press this matter upon congressmen year after year to be repulsed by those who were opposed and only tolerated by those in favor who had many other matters on hand which to them seemed of much greater importance Oh if men only could know how hard it is for women to be forever snubbed when they attempt to plead for their rights! It is perfectly disheartening that no member feels any especial interest or earnest determination in pushing this question of woman suffrage to all men only a side issue she writes in this little confidant but not even in her letters is there ever a note of discouragement To the world at large and to those who were associated with her she was always brave bright and hopeful It causes a keen heartache to reflect upon how she crucified herself for fifty years unfaltering and uncomplaining in order to make conditions better for womankind To Hon William D Kelley of Pennsylvania who believed in woman suffrage and voted for it but did not feel enough interest to push the matter in Congress she wrote January 6 1884 No one shrinks more from making herself obnoxious than I do and but for the sake of all women your darling Florence included I should never again say a word to you on the subject of using your influence to secure the passage of a Sixteenth Amendment proposition Last winter you put off my appeal for help with This is the short session and the tariff question is of momentous importance Now since this is the long session will you not take hold of this work and with the same earnestness that you do other questions? It is cruel for you to leave your daughter so full of hope and resolve to suffer the humiliations of disfranchisement she already feels so keenly and which she will find more and more galling as she grows into the stronger and grander woman she is sure to be If it were your son who for any cause was denied his right to have his opinion counted you would compass sea and land to lift the ban from him And yet the crime of denial in his case would be no greater than in that of your daughter It is only because men are so accustomed to the ignoring of womans opinions that they do not believe women suffer from the injustice as would men precisely as people used to scout the idea that negroes whose parents before them always had been enslaved suffered from that cruel bondage as white men would Now will you not set about in good earnest to secure the enfranchisement of woman? Why do not the Republicans push this question? The vote on Keifers resolution showed almost a party line Of the 124 nays only 4 were Republicans while of the 85 yeas only 13 were Democrats Even should you fail to get another committee the discussion and the vote would array the members and set each man and party in their true places to be seen of all men and all women too The term of the select committee on woman suffrage having expired with the close of the Forty-seventh Congress a new one was appointed by the Senate of the Forty-eighth The House committee on rules refused to report such a committee but placed the question in the hands of Representative Warren Keifer of Ohio who made a gallant fight for it on the floor during which he said Is not the right of petition a constitutional right? Has not woman in this country at least risen above the rim and horizon of servitude discredit and disgrace and has she not a right representing as she does in many instances great questions of property to present her appeals to this national council and have them wisely and judiciously considered? I think it is due to our wives daughters mothers and sisters to afford them an avenue through which they can legitimately and judicially reach the ear of this great nation He was ably assisted by Mr Belford of Colorado The measure to appoint this committee was bitterly opposed by Mr Reagan of Texas who said in a long speech When woman so far misunderstands her duty as to want to go to working on the roads and making rails and serving in the militia and going into the army I want to protect her against it The vote resulted--yeas 85 nays 124 absent or not voting 112 Immediately after the return of members from the holiday recess Miss Anthony wrote to each of the 112 asking how he would vote if the question came up again To these letters 52 replies were received 26 from Republicans all of whom would vote yes 26 from Democrats 10 of whom would vote yes 10 no while 6 did not know how they would vote As these 36 affirmative votes added to the 85 yeas would so nearly have overcome the adverse majority John D White of Kentucky at the solicitation of Miss Anthony made another earnest effort in February to secure the desired committee but the Democrats refused to allow the question to come to a vote She was greatly disappointed at the failure to get the select committee but afterwards became of the opinion that it was more advantageous to return to the old plan of working through the judiciary committee Miss Anthony had to be continually on the alert to head off zealous but injudicious women who were determined to commit the suffrage movement to the various ologies and isms of the day and especially to personal matters Even a woman so intellectually great as Mrs Stanton could not be relied upon always to make her individual opinions subserve what was demanded of her position as president of the National Association In January Miss Anthony received a document which Mrs Stanton had prepared as an open letter to be signed by both of them officially and given to the press congratulating Frederick Douglass upon his marriage to a white woman and sympathizing with him because of the adverse criticism it had called out! She especially urged that he be given a prominent place on the program at the approaching convention Miss Anthony replied at once I do hope you wont put your foot into the question of intermarriage of the races It has no place on our platform any more than the question of no marriage at all or of polygamy and so far as I can prevent it shall not be brought there I beg you therefore not to congratulate him publicly Were there a proposition to punish the woman and leave the man to go scot free then we should have a protest to make against the invidious discrimination The question of the amalgamation of the different races is a scientific one affecting women and men alike I do not propose to have it discussed on our platform Our intention at this convention is to make every one who hears or reads believe in the grand principle of equality of rights and chances for women and if they see on our program the name of Douglass every thought will be turned toward the subject of amalgamation and away from that of woman and her disfranchised Neither you nor I have the right thus to complicate or compromise our question and if we take the bits in our teeth in one direction we must expect our compeers to do the same in others You very well know that if you plunge in as your letter proposes your endorsement will be charged upon me and the whole association Do not throw around that marriage the halo of a pure and lofty duty to break down race lines Your sympathy has run away with your judgment Lovingly and fearfully yours It is hardly necessary to say that the open letter was not published Everybodys burdens were laid upon Miss Anthonys shoulders In looking over the mass of correspondence it seems as if each writer wanted something and looked to her to supply it All expected her to take the lead to do the planning to bear the responsibility and usually she was equal to the demand but even her brave spirit could not resist an occasional groan on the pages of the diary When a new accession to the ranks from whom she expected great assistance wrote I do not know how to plan but tell me what to do and I will obey she says My heart sinks within me so few seem to use their brain-power on ways and means And again This drain of helpless women able and willing to work but utterly ignorant of how to do it wears me out body and soul She was greatly distressed because so many of the younger women were frequently incapacitated by illness and writes O the weak-bodied girls of the present generation they make me heart-sick! But never did the women themselves know of these feelings To the younger ones she wrote Dont give up beat at any of those places till I have dropped my plummet into them Your young shoulders will have to learn to bear the crotchets of all sorts of people and not bend or break under them Put all the blame on me they may abuse me but not you It makes my heart ache every minute to see you so tired Vent all your ill-feelings on me but keep sweet as June roses to everybody else It does not pay to lose your temper You will have to learn to let people pile injustice on you and then trust to time to right it all If on rare occasions she spoke a word of censure it was followed by a letter in the next mail full of sorrow and repentance She always signed herself even in the darkest hours Yours with love and hope Beautiful optimism sublime courage! Sunday February 3 1884 Miss Anthony read in the morning papers of the sudden death of Wendell Phillips He had been to her always the one being without a peer the purest sweetest best of men The news overwhelmed her with grief and she wrote at once to Robert Purvis How cut down I am at the telegram Wendell Phillips is dead and I know you are equally so I hope you can go on to Boston to the funeral and help tenderly to lay away that most precious human clay Who shall say the fitting word for Wendell Phillips at this last hour as lovingly and beautifully as he has done so many many times for the grand men and women who have gone before him? There seem none left but you and Parker Pillsbury to pour out your souls dearest love in his memory Would that I had the tongue of an angel and could go and bear my testimony to the grandeur of that noblest of Gods works! I can think of no one who can rightly and fully estimate that glorious character What a sad hour for his beloved wife! He said to me on my last visit My one wish has come to be that I may live to bury Ann He doubtless knew of his impending disease of the heart On whose shoulders will fall the mantle of Wendell Phillips? When will the children of men ever listen to such a matchless voice? How poor the world seems! In sorrow I am with you She could not stay away and inclement as was the weather went to Boston three days later to look for the last time upon the loved face At the request of many ladies in Washington the National Convention was held in March instead of earlier in the winter to avoid the social distractions which always precede the Lenten season The ladies were pleasantly received by President Arthur19 This was an exceptionally brilliant convention a noteworthy feature being the large number of letters containing the greetings of the distinguished men and women of Great Britain whom Miss Anthony and Mrs Stanton had met and interested during their trip abroad The following was read from Matthew Simpson senior bishop in the Methodist church among his last public utterances as he died a few months later For more than thirty years I have been in favor of suffrage for woman I was led to this position not by the consideration of the question of natural rights or of alleged injustice or of inequality before the law but by what I believed would be her influence on the great moral questions of the day Were the ballot in the hands of women I am satisfied that the evils of intemperance would be greatly lessened and I fear without that ballot we shall not succeed against the saloons and kindred evils in large cities You will doubtless have many obstacles placed in your way there will be many conflicts to sustain but I have no doubt that the coming years will see the triumph of your cause and that our higher civilization and morality will rejoice in the work which enlightened women will accomplish20 Illustration Autograph M Simpson Both Senate and House committees granted hearings and eloquent addresses were made by delegates from many States Miss Anthony said in part This is the fifteenth year we have appeared before Congress in person and the nineteenth by petitions asking national protection for women in the exercise of their right to vote In the winter of 1865 and 1866 we sent your honorable body a ten-thousand prayer asking you not to put male in the second section of the proposed Fourteenth Amendment and again we appealed to you by thousands of petitions that you would add sex after race or color in the Fifteenth but all to no avail Then by an eighty-thousand petition in 1871 we demanded the enactment of a declaratory law that women had the right to vote under the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment This too was denied us not only by Congress but by the Supreme Court which held that the framers of the amendment had only colored men in their thought therefore none others could come within its purview From 1876 to the present we have from year to year poured into Congress hundreds of thousands of petitions asking you to take the initiative step for another amendment which shall specifically prohibit the disfranchisement of women But you say why do you not go to your several States to secure this right? I answer because we have neither the women nor the money to make the canvasses of the thirty-eight States school district by school district to educate each individual man out of the old belief that woman was created to be his subject Four State legislatures submitted the question of striking male from their constitutions--Kansas Michigan Colorado and Nebraska--and we made the best canvass of each which was possible for a disfranchised class outside of all political help Negro suffrage was again and again overwhelmingly voted down in various States and you know gentlemen that if the negro had never had the ballot until the majority of white men particularly the foreign born had voted yes he would have gone without it until the crack of doom It was because of this prejudice of the unthinking majority that Congress submitted the question of the negros enfranchisement to the legislatures of the several States to be adjudicated by the educated broadened representatives of the people We now appeal to you to lift the decision ofour_ question from the vote of the populace to that of the legislatures that thereby you may be as considerate and just to the women of this nation as you were to the freedmen Every new privilege granted to woman has been by the legislatures The liberal laws for married women the right of the wife to own and control her inherited property and separate earnings the right of women to vote at school elections in a dozen States full suffrage in two Territories all have been gained through the legislatures Had any one of these beneficent propositions been submitted to the vote of the rank and file do you believe a majority would have placed their sanction upon it? I do not and I beg you Mr Chairman and gentlemen of the committee that you will at once recommend to the House the submission of the proposition now before you and thus place the decision of this great constitutional question of the right of one-half the people of this republic to a voice in the government with the legislatures of the several States You need not fear that our enfranchisement will come too suddenly or too soon by this method After the proposition shall have passed Congress by the requisite two-thirds vote it may require five ten or twenty years to secure its ratification by the necessary three-fourths of the State legislatures butonce submitted by Congress it always will stand until ratified by the States_ It takes all too many of us women from our homes and from the works of charity and education in our respective localities even to come to Washington session after session until Congress shall have submitted the proposition and then to go from legislature to legislature urging its adoption But when you insist that we shall beg at the feet of each individual voter of every one of the States native and foreign black and white learned and ignorant you doom us to incalculable hardships and sacrifices and to most exasperating insults and humiliations I pray you to save us from the fate of waiting and working for our freedom until we shall have educated the ignorant masses of men to consent to give their wives and sisters equality of rights with themselves You surely will not compel us to await the enlightenment of all the freedmen of this nation and the newly-made voters from the monarchial governments of the old world! Liberty for ones self is a natural instinct possessed alike by all men but to be willing to accord liberty to another is the result of education of self-discipline of the practice of the golden rule Therefore we ask that the question of equality of rights to women shall be decided by the picked men of the nation in Congress and the picked men of the several States in their respective legislatures The Senate committee again submitted a majority report in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment enfranchising women signed by T W Palmer Blair Lapham and Anthony The minority report by Joseph E Brown Cockrell and Fair began The undersigned believe that the Creator intended that the sphere of the males and females of our race should be different etc The House Judiciary Committee gave a majority report in the negative21 The minority report in favor was signed by Thomas B Reed Maine Ezra B Taylor Ohio Thomas M Browne Indiana Moses A McCoid Iowa It is one of the keenest clearest expositions of the absurdity of the objections against woman suffrage that ever has been made and ends with this trenchant paragraph It is sometimes asserted that women now have a great influence in politics through their husbands and brothers That is undoubtedly true But this is just the kind of influence which is not wholesome for the community for it is influence unaccompanied by responsibility People are always ready to recommend to others what they would not do themselves If it be true that women can not be prevented from exercising political influence is not that only another reason why they should be steadied in their political action by that proper sense of responsibility which comes from acting themselves? We conclude then that every reason which in this country bestows the ballot upon man is equally applicable to the proposition to bestow the ballot upon woman and in our judgment there is no foundation for the fear that woman will thereby become unfitted for all the duties she has hitherto performed Miss Anthony mailed 500 packages of copies of this report to different points for distribution Upon the urgent invitation of the suffrage association of Connecticut she went there for a few days to assist at their State convention but in a letter to Mrs Spofford she said I shall return tomorrow night if possible I keep thinking of those men at the Capitol not doing what I want them to She afterwards wrote to May Wright Sewall My plan is to get away from here the minute I can do so without letting our work suffer in Congress A week ago the House Judiciary Committee voted down a motion to print our hearing speeches Yesterday I went up and called out a Democrat who I knew had voted no and hence could move to reconsider and he promised to go back and thus move and did so and Mr Browne of Indiana asked leave of the House to print them I wish you would write to Mr Browne that he is splendid and our main help now in the committee Cockrell has been trying to prevent printing the Senate hearing but Blair Lapham Palmer and Anthony are bound it shall be printed Still all would fall flat and dead if some one were not here to keep them in mind of their duty to us Illustration Autograph Yours c Thomas M Browne Miss Anthony remained in Washington till April 14 managing her forces like an experienced general until the last gun had been fired When she returned home ready to begin work on the History she found to her amazement that the officer who had been charged with preparing the report of the Sixteenth National Suffrage Convention a woman of great literary ability had given it up in despair declaring that it would be utterly impossible to make anything creditable out of such a mass of unsatisfactory material most of which would have to be entirely re-written Miss Anthony did not stop to sit down and weep but wrote her at once to send to Rochester every document she had in her possession Then taking all of them to Mrs Stanton who had gone to her old paternal home at Johnstown they arranged edited re-wrote and put into shape the conglomerate of letters speeches etc and in less than two weeks prepared and sent to the printer the most complete report ever made of a National convention22 The middle of May after two years interruption Miss Anthony and Mrs Stanton set themselves diligently to finish the third volume of the History of Woman Suffrage all the boxes and trunks of material having been shipped from Tenafly Although submerged in the avalanche of old documents Miss Anthonys mind was full of current events She writes in her journal June 2 I wait with bated breath the news from Oregon where today the men are voting on the question of womans enfranchisement My heart almost stands stills I hope against hope but still I hope When the news of the defeat comes she says Dear Mrs Duniway with all that debt left on her shoulders which she assumed to carry on the campaign! I felt so agonized for her that on the very day of election I rushed to the bank and sent her 100 We must not leave her to carry it alone after all her brave work I have written a dozen letters to friends asking them to give her assistance I feel like a lion champing the bars of his cage shut up here digging and delving among the records of the past when I long to be out doing the work of the present In a letter received from Senator Palmer at this time he says I fully sympathize with your regret and chagrin over the reverse in Oregon but hardly with your conclusion viz that the women should stop asking legislatures to submit this question to the electors to have it killed by the majority made up of ignorance and whiskey native and foreign and all go to Congress for success etc It seems to me that nothing is to be lost and much to be gained by local discussions and temporary defeats You know in 1850 Webster in his unfortunate Revere House speech stigmatized the anti-slavery movement as a rub-a-dub agitation and Wendell Phillips closed his masterly philippic thereon with what was accepted as a motto Agitate! Agitate!! Agitate!!! Another decade of that rub-a-dub agitation sufficed to divide the continent in a political earthquake and from out the chasm the negro emerged to citizenship It may still require years to educate a majority of our women to demand the franchise and a majority of our men or their representatives in Congress and the legislatures to proclaim it but that the way leads through constant agitation I make no doubt The still pool casts nothing to shore Illustration Autograph With high personal esteem I have the honor to be Very truly yours T W Palmer She watches events across the water and writes on July 7 Well the House of Lords is today discussing whether 2000000 farm laborers shall have the ballot placed in their hands while the half-million more or less women who employ them are left without it What an outrage that Mr Gladstone refused to allow Mr Woodalls amendment to his bill to be at least voted upon! He applied the party whip and made voting for the woman suffrage amendment disloyalty to the government and over one hundred Liberals who had previously declared themselves in favor of womens sharing in this new extension of the franchise voted against allowing them to do so I do not believe a more humiliating abnegation of principle at the behest of a party leader ever was witnessed in our Congress The national political conventions in the summer of 1884 received the usual appeal to recognize the claims of women The Republican Democratic Anti-Monopoly and Greenback parties equivocated although the last two nominated Benjamin F Butler an avowed advocate of woman suffrage the Prohibition convention relegated the question to the States23 The American party put in a plank and nominated S C Pomeroy a champion of woman suffrage but it had too small a following to offer any hope of success Blaine was not a friend Logan was an earnest one Cleveland was not acceptable to many women Hendricks had never shown himself favorable In the midst of such a conglomeration the wise thing for all women would have been to remain non-partisan and take no share in the campaign Miss Anthony and Mrs Stanton however watching events from their secluded nook issued a manifesto urging women to stand by the Republican party They were led to take this action by the tendency of large numbers to rush to the support of the Prohibitionists because of their suffrage plank and they believed that if women were determined to work for some political party the Republican at that time held out most hope This aroused the antagonism of the Prohibitionists and Democrats both men and women and afforded the strongest possible object lesson to Miss Anthony of the wisdom of henceforth adhering to her policy of non-partisanship until one of thedominant_ parties should declare unmistakably for woman suffrage and advocate it by means of press and platform In August occurred the death of Sarah Pugh the gentle Quaker and staunch Abolitionist her old and faithful friend It was followed by that of Frances D Gage a few months later and in December passed away the true and helpful ally William Henry Channing Each left a void in her heart and yet the memory of these great souls impelled to renewed effort There was no cessation of the work on the History which was slowly evolved through the heat of summer and the beautiful days of early autumn but by the end of October the funds were exhausted the money left by Mrs Eddy was still in litigation and Miss Anthony again went on the lecture platform speaking almost every night through November and December She did not fail however to look carefully after the interests of the Seventeenth National Convention which met as usual in Washington January 20 1885 A letter from Clarina Howard Nichols was sent to be read at this meeting but the hand which penned it was stilled in death before it was received Of all the pioneer workers with whom Miss Anthony had been associated in the early days so full of scorn ridicule and abuse Mrs Nichols was among the nearest and dearest a forceful speaker and writer a tender loving woman It was in this convention that the resolution denouncing dogmas and creeds was introduced by Mrs Stanton and caused much commotion and heated argument Miss Anthony opposed it saying I object to the words derived from Judaism It does not matter where the dogma came from I was on the old Garrison platform and found long ago that the settling of any question of human rights by peoples interpretation of the Bible is utterly impossible I hope we shall not go back to that war We all know what we want and that is the recognition of womans perfect equality We all admit that such recognition never has been granted in the centuries of the past but for us to begin a discussion here as to who established this injustice would be anything but profitable Let those who wish go back into their history but I beg it shall not be done on our platform24 The public which always longed for a sensation at these suffrage conventions and was disappointed if it did not come seized upon this resolution and press and pulpit made it a text The following Sunday W W Patton D D president of Howard University preached in the Congregational church of Washington a sermon entitled Woman and Skepticism He took the ground that as soon as women depart from their natural sphere they become skeptical if not immoral He gave as examples Hypatia Madame Roland Harriet Martineau Frances Power Cobbe and George Eliot! Then turning his attention to America he said that the recent convention of woman suffragists gave evidence of atheism and immorality and that Victoria Woodhull was the representative of the movement in this country25 And this when Mrs Woodhull had not been on the suffrage platform for thirteen years! Miss Anthony and Mrs Stanton occupied front seats and at the close of the sermon went forward shook hands with the preacher and Miss Anthony remarked earnestly Doctor your mother if you have one should lay you across her knee and give you a good spanking for that sermon O no said Mrs Stanton quickly allow me to congratulate you I have been trying for years to make women understand that the worst enemy they have is in the pulpit and you have illustrated the truth of it Then while the great divine was trying to recover his breath they walked out of the church The nine days commotion which this produced can be imagined better than described After some reflection Miss Anthony regretted that she should have been provoked into her remark but Mrs Stanton wrote Dont worry a moment The more I think about it the better I like it because it was the most contemptuous thing which could have been said Like that shot at Lexington it will go round the world On February 6 Thomas W Palmer called up in the Senate the resolution for a Sixteenth Amendment and supported it by that masterly speech which ever since has been one of the strongest suffrage campaign documents At the request of Miss Anthony thousands of copies were sent out under his frank She went from Washington to Boston to attend a meeting of the National branch of the Massachusetts association and soon afterwards on March 2 started for the New Orleans Exposition She was warmly welcomed by Mrs Caroline E Merrick wife of Judge E T Merrick at whose lovely home she was entertained during part of her stay It was her first visit to the Crescent City and she was soon deluged with invitations to speak and received many charming tokens of the justly-famed southern hospitality She spoke before the Womans Club in the hall of the Continental Guards with May Wright Sewall representative from Indiana gave seven addresses in as many days before schools and colleges and by invitation of the Press Association spoke in Agricultural Hall at the exposition and visited the headquarters of the different papers The next day by request of Commissioner Truman she gave an address and held a reception at the New York headquarters Her last appearance was at Tulane Hall under the auspices of the teachers of the city schools She was everywhere beautifully received although her doctrines were new and unpopular and at the close of each meeting her audience crowded about her with words of appreciation and cordiality Miss Anthony here met for the first time Catherine Cole of the editorial staff and Mrs Eliza J Nicholson owner and manager of the Picayune The latter presented her with an Indian basket filled to overflowing with orange blossoms and this tribute was paid in her paper THE APOSTLE OF WOMANS RIGHTS--Miss Susan B Anthony has made a most favorable impression upon the New Orleans public and has by her gentleness and courtesy won many friends for herself and her cause She came here a total stranger and recognized the fact that there were many who did not approve of her or her doctrines She has been sincere truly polite and simply womanly in all her dealings with the southern people and by these very qualities has commanded the respectful esteem of all Miss Anthony has not striven to make herself solid with the people who give the best dinners The workingwoman the unfashionable woman have been made as heartily welcome as the leader of society and for their appreciation they have been repaid by the friendship and esteem of one of the grandest old maids that ever lived The Times-Democrat and Daily States also gave full and favorable reports of her visit and lectures The two weeks allowed for this holiday sped quickly away and Miss Anthony left for the North on March 20 laden with luncheon flowers and many tokens of affection from the women of New Orleans At Marshall Tex she dined with President and Mrs Culver of Bishops University and reached St Louis Sunday evening where she was the guest of her nephew Arthur A Mosher and his wife The next four or five weeks were spent in the lecture field at hard work under the management of the Slayton Bureau In answer to her letter of regret at not meeting Mrs J Ellen Foster at an Iowa convention as she had requested Mrs Foster wrote I was sorry enough not to see you but I gave the people your message in the evening Dear soul how long you have stood for the truth delivered unto you! God bless your words and works I do not see creeds and dogmas just as you see them I do not believe in all that you do but I believe in you! The last of April came the long-expected summons to Boston to receive the legacy of Mrs Eddy the courts having sustained the will While eastward bound crossing the State of Illinois newspapers were brought on the train announcing the death of Grant and she writes The weather is lovely and springlike today but how still and solemn it seems out here on these broad prairies with that great general gone forever! The case had been in litigation three years Benjamin F Butler appearing for Miss Anthony and Lucy Stone His fees were very reasonable but several thousand dollars were swallowed up in the suit The legacy in first-class securities stocks bonds etc was paid April 27 each receiving 2412526 Miss Anthony gives an amusing account in one of her letters of the awful nightmare she had on board the sleeper going home when she dreamed that a woman was at the head of her berth stifling her while a man knelt in front his hand cautiously creeping toward the inside pocket where she had sewed the money and bonds She awoke with a scream and did not go to sleep again If this bequest had been left to Miss Anthony for her own personal use she could not have felt one-half the joy she now experienced in having the means to carry on the work which always had been so seriously impeded for lack of funds Of course its receipt was heralded far and wide by the papers and appeals began to pour in from all sides nor were they always appeals but often demands Scores of women considered themselves entitled to a share because the money had been left to further the cause of woman One wanted it to help lift a mortgage on her home others to educate their children to pay a debt to reward them for the valuable services they had given to woman suffrage to start a paper to carry one already started and so on without end The men also were willing to relieve her of a portion I am terribly oppressed by it all Miss Anthony writes and nothing would make me happier than to respond to every one but my money would melt away in a month It was ludicrous and yet pitiful to see certain persons who had repudiated her in days gone by because she was too radical and too aggressive discovering all at once how much they always had valued her and how anxious they had been for a long time to renew the old friendship--the common story ancient as the world The one thing she was determined to do first of all was to complete the History of Woman Suffrage upon which she and Mrs Stanton had spent all the days that could be spared for nearly ten years The work had been delayed by the many other demands upon their time by their trips abroad but more than all else by lack of money The authors were to pay for composition stereotyping the making of the plates for the engravings and the printing of the same Fowler Wells for the paper press-work binding and advertising Miss Anthony and her co-workers were to receive only 12-12 per cent commission on the sales It readily may be seen that she did not go into this as a money-making scheme Her only thought her only desire was to collect the facts in connection with the movement to secure the rights of women before they should be scattered and lost and to preserve and put them into shape for reference In preparing the first two volumes she had used every dollar she had been able to earn and all she could obtain from generous friends and there were still large unpaid bills Now with plenty of money at her command she bought out the rights of Fowler Wells and engaged Charles Mann of Rochester to print the third volume Mrs Stanton had returned to Tenafly and there Miss Anthony again sent all the trunks and boxes of precious documents She completed her lecture engagements and the first of June 1885 found the two women once more hard at work I really think of you with pity these hot midsummer days wrote Mrs Sewall to Mrs Stanton under the lash of blessed Susans relentless energy but the reflection that she applies it with the most vigor to her own back enables one to regard that instrument after all with more admiration than terror It was indeed true that Mrs Stantons luxury and ease-loving nature required much urging27 and while Miss Anthony took upon herself all the drudgery possible and all the financial anxiety and burden she was compelled to keep Mrs Stanton keyed up to do a great portion of the literary work It is the one drawback at every turn she writes that I have not the faculty to frame easy polished sentences If I could but do this I would finish up the History without asking aid of anyone And again It has been the bane of my life that I am powerless to put on paper the glimpses of thoughts which come and go like flashes of lightning As has been said before in these pages she is a perfect critic and delightful letter-writer but finds difficulty in doing what is called literary work Practice undoubtedly would have enabled her to overcome this but she felt always that her chief strength lay in executive ability Illustration MISS ANTHONY AND MRS STANTON WRITING THE HISTORY OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE Early in June Miss Anthony slipped away from the work long enough to go to the Progressive Friends meeting at Kennett Square Penn where she was the guest of Deborah Pennock and met for the first time Sarah J Eddy In her diary she says Last evening as I sat on the sofa Miss Eddy put her arms around me and said I am so glad I love you I should have felt very sorry if I had not And so should I for the sake of her dear mother and grandfather who had so much confidence in me The two went on to New York together and then over to Mrs Stantons for a little visit and the friendship formed at that time has been maintained ever since Later when Miss Eddy was going to Rochester to a convention Miss Anthony wrote Mrs Hallowell I am sure you would be glad to entertain her she is a sweet lovely little woman thoroughly sympathizing with everything and everybody that suffers injustice I am very sorry that sister Mary and I must be away and can not have the dear girl with us Miss Anthony experienced a great disadvantage in being so far away from her publisher the more especially as she had to send a chapter at a time read proofs of each as soon as it was set up send back corrected proof get the revises etc and she soon found it necessary to spend about half her time in Rochester The women who were preparing the chapters for their respective States delayed the work neglecting to send them when promised many occupied twice as much space as had been assigned them and were highly indignant when Mrs Stanton used the blue pencil unsparingly on their productions They vented their feelings on Miss Anthony knowing that nothing they could say would ruffle Mrs Stantons equipoise and she writes in her diary To decide between the two has almost torn me in twain People who can write are so tenacious each thinking her own style better than any other while poor I dont know which is the best Every few weeks she was obliged to rush over to Fayetteville to confer with Mrs Gage who was industriously preparing her part of the work Urgent appeals came from women in Michigan Minnesota Wisconsin Kansas and Indiana that they could not possibly make a success of their State conventions unless she came to their assistance but she steeled her heart against them and stuck closely to her task From the lecture bureau came a list of ten engagements at 50 a night but she refused them Some of the expressions in her letters of those busy days show the state of her mind better than could volumes of description All the work of today put aside to grope into the old past I feel like rushing to you this very minute but here Mrs Stanton and I are scratching scratching every hour not each others eyes but the History papers I am a fish out of water It makes me feel growly all the time I can not get away from my ball and chain I think well make things snap and crackle a little This is the biggest swamp I ever tried to wriggle through Well both put on our thinking caps and I guess get quite a lot of funnies in the reminiscences Now here is the publishers screech for money O to get out of this History prison! I am too tired to write--I mean too lazy No warhorse ever panted for the rush of battle more than I for outside work I love to make history but hate to write it On November 12 Mrs Stantons seventieth birthday was celebrated by a large reception held in the parlors of Dr Lozier in New York where Mrs Stanton read a charming paper on The Pleasures of Old Age Her daughter Harriot Stanton Blatch sent the following bright and breezy message How I wish I could give my congratulations in the flesh! Distance is the foe of love Kiss dear Susan and let her kiss you for me On November 12 I shall think of you both for you two are not easily separated in my mind and there will be a tenderness in my thoughts and a thankfulness that you both have lived In your worries over the History remember that at least one woman appreciates the fact that her life has been made easier because of your combined public work You ought to be overflowing with gratitude for each others existence for neither without the other would have achieved the work you have accomplished Every day of your lives let your hearts praise the good fortune that brought you together Friendship is the grandest relation in the world and I feel infinitely blessed in having two such women as friends You and dear Susan are not yet to be sainted you have no end of work in you still and must labor on for many a long year and gain many a triumphant victory I throw up my cap and cry hurrah for you two grand old warriors! The curl is from Noras little head She shall be taught to reverence her Queen Mother and Maid of Honor Susan Now farewell dear ladies I am wishing you on birthdays and every day a long and happy life The next morning came the cablegram announcing the sudden death in Switzerland of the mother of Julia and Rachel Foster Miss Anthony dropped all work when the sisters arrived at New York went with them to Philadelphia and rendered every possible consolation and assistance But not even to go to Washington to push the work in Congress and arrange for the National Convention would she delay the task she was so anxious to finish She wrote scores of letters however in regard to both and the congressmen particularly had reason to feel that she had not forgotten their promises Her long and persistent labors were rewarded for the close of 1885 found the whole third volume of the History in the hands of the printers FOOTNOTES 19 An official request was sent to the heads of the departments to permit the women employes to attend one session of this convention but it was refused A few days later permission was given them to go to Mrs McElroys reception at the White House and the male employes were given a half-holiday to attend the exercises on St Patricks Day 20 The Methodist bishops Bowman Warren Newman Haven Turner and Walters have favored woman suffrage 21 Signed by Maybury Michigan Poland Vermont Tucker Virginia Hammond Georgia Culbertson Texas Moulton Illinois Broadhead Missouri Dorsheimer New York Collins Massachusetts Seney Ohio Bisbee Florida 22 Miss Anthonys letters show how desirous she was that everybody who assisted at these conventions should have full measure of credit They are earnest and anxious to do for womans cause and I want them treated fairly and leniently as to all mistakes Again she writes Since Oregon was never before represented in our conventions her speakers must have more room in the report than we old stagers 23 When Miss Anthony learned that this action had been taken with the sanction of Frances E Willard she pointed out to her in vigorous language how the Prohibition-Republicans had left that party this year because a temperance resolution had failed in the platform committee and had gone over to the Prohibition party charging that the Republicans were cowardly Yet the very first act of this Prohibition convention to which Miss Willard was a delegate was to abandon the idea of National Supremacy and accept that of State Rights in order to conciliate the southern members She further said When the time comes in which it will be political expediency for the Prohibition party to throw woman suffrage overboard altogether over it will go Miss Willard lived to see this prophecy fulfilled at the National Prohibition Convention of 1896 24 Apropos of this discussion an amusing anecdote is related of Miss Anthony When confronted in an argument with the passage of scripture Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands etc she replied Gentlemen no one objects to the husband being the head of the wife as Christ was the head of the church--to crucify himself what we object to is his crucifying his wife 25 This account of the sermon is taken from the reports of half a dozen reputable newspapers 26 This is the only instance where a woman has bequeathed a large amount of money to the cause of equal rights although a number of small bequests have been made Women have given millions of dollars to churches charities and colleges for men but comparatively nothing to secure freedom for those of their own sex 27 In one of Miss Anthonys letters she relates with amusement that Mr Stanton had just come in and seeing his wife lying on the couch remarked Ah resting I see No she replied I am exercising by lying down CHAPTER XXXIV MANY TRIPS--FIRST VOTE ON SIXTEENTH AMENDMENT 1886-1887 Miss Anthony started for Washington toward the last of January 1886 with a lighter heart than she had possessed for many years The dreadful burden of the labor on the History was lifted all the bills were paid she had given a helping hand to several of the old workers which made her very happy and she had one or two good dresses in her trunk There was nothing which the paragrapher who hated what Miss Anthony represented liked so well as to make disagreeable flings at her clothes and yet it is an indisputable fact of history that she was one of the most perfectly dressed women on the platform although her tastes were very plain and simple A lady once wrote her asking if it would not be possible to make the suffrage conventions a little more æsthetic they were so painfully practical She sent the letter to Mrs Stanton who commented Well now perhaps if we could paint injustice in delicate tints set in a framework of poetical argument we might more easily entrap the Senator Edmunds and Oscar Wilde types of Adams sons Suppose at our next convention all of us dress in pale green have a faint and subdued gaslight with pink shades write our speeches in verse and chant them to a guitar accompaniment Ah me! alas! how can we reform the world æsthetically? The members of Congress always knew when Miss Anthony had arrived in Washington Other women accepted their word that they were going to do something and waited patiently at home Miss Anthony followed them up and saw that they did it If she could not find them at the Capitol she went to their homes If they promised to introduce a certain measure on a certain day she was in the gallery looking them squarely in the face If they failed to do it they found her waiting for them at the close of the session Senator Blair wrote this humorous note January 15 I thought just as likely as not you would come fussing round before I got your amendment reported to the Senate I wish you would go home Cockrell has agreed to let me know soon whether he wont allow the report to be made right off without any bother and I have been to him several times before I dont see what you want to meddle for anyway Go off and get married! Illustration Autograph I hope you will live always in this world Heaven has got more than its share of good people already Sincerely Respectfully Henry W Blair Miss Anthony has been directly connected with every action taken by Congress or by any congressional committee on the question of woman suffrage There are on file among her papers hundreds of letters from members during the past thirty years showing her energy and persistence in compelling attention to this subject in learning who were its friends in attempting to convert the doubters and in spurring the believers to effort This is something for the women of the future to remember The Eighteenth Annual Convention opened February 17 Prominent features were a fine address by Rev Rush R Shippen of All Souls church and the first appearance on the platform of Mary F Eastman Ada C Sweet the pension agent the eloquent southern speakers Mrs Elizabeth A Meriwether and Mrs Sallie Clay Bennett and the talented German Madame Clara Neymann Among many letters was one from George W Childs to Miss Anthony saying I am always glad to hear from you and I keep track of your continued good work Do not be discouraged I take pleasure in sending the enclosed check 100 with my sincere regards and very best wishes The crowds were so great that policemen had to be stationed at the door to prevent late comers from trying to enter during the evening sessions The resolutions scored the bill before Congress proposing to disfranchise all Utah women both Gentile and Mormon to punish the crime of polygamy The usual hearing was granted before the congressional committees The fight for woman suffrage in the Forty-ninth Congress was conducted by Ezra B Taylor of Ohio who prepared the favorable minority report of the House Judiciary Committee The adverse majority report was signed by John Randolph Tucker of Virginia On March 25 the general slipped up to New York City to assist her forces at the State convention and then hastened back to Washington to direct the main line of attack The diary says March 30--Went to House of Representatives saw Messrs Tucker and Taylor of judiciary committee both promised to report soon Then went to Senate saw Messrs Blair Stanford and Bowen all agreed to work to bring up our bill by May 1 In the evening took a cab and went in a pouring rain to Senator Stanfords where I spent an hour How keen and true are his perceptions in regard to public questions! March 31--Pouring rain dark and muggy I went to the Senate sat with Mrs Dolph and Mrs Stanford heard Senator Dolphs fine speech on the admission of Washington Territory as a State and his splendid word for woman suffrage Mrs Dolph took me home in her carriage April 1--Went to the Senate again to secure pledges for votes and speeches for the Sixteenth Amendment Bill Got Senator Dolphs strongest paragraphs and at 8 P M went to the top floor of the Associated Press rooms and gave them to Mr Boynton who sent them over the wires April 9--The United States Senate today voted down Eustis motion to refuse to admit Washington Territory unless the woman suffrage clause were eliminated from its constitution 25 to 12 Senator Ingalls was the only Republican who voted with the enemy A few days later Miss Anthony received the following from Mrs Caroline E Merrick of New Orleans I feel defrauded that I never knew you until last year Judge Merrick says you are the most sensible person he ever met without any sex qualifications of course Like you I was indignant at Mr Eustis in regard to his course toward Washington Territory I was ashamed and blushed for my Louisiana senator that time Thanks for your sympathy in my illness When my head lies low I pray that you may find another and even better friend in my State who will come to the front in the cause of equal rights for women An extract from a letter of Rev Olympia Brown to Mrs Stanton shows how much the old workers as well as the young depended upon Miss Anthony I wish to inquire what has become of Susan? You know she is my North Star I take all my bearings from her and when I lose sight of her I wander helplessly uncertain of my course The diary of April 30 says Heard Phoebe Couzins had been taken to Hot Springs terribly crippled with rheumatism Wrote her at once and enclosed 100 telling her I wanted it used to provide delicacies and make her comfortable I have thought it would be Phoebe whom I should take with me on my southern tour next year but I fear her work is done Illustration Caroline E Merrick Signed I am thine ever faithfully and affectionately Caroline E Merrick By the middle of May 1886 the last bit of History proof was read and unlimited leave of absence was granted Miss Anthony by her publisher while the indexer and binder completed the work which was begun in 1876 On the 19th she started for Kansas stopping for the usual visit in Chicago with her cousins In Kansas she visited her brothers at Leavenworth and Fort Scott for nearly two months making an occasional speech On the morning of July 4 under the auspices of the W C T U she addressed a large audience at Salina on The powerlessness of woman so long as she is dependent on man for bread In the hot afternoon as she was about to enjoy a nap word came that a hundred people had united in a request that she should speak again as they had come from ten to twenty miles on purpose to hear her so she returned to the grove and Mrs Griffith State evangelist kindly yielded her hour On July 11 Miss Anthony went again to Chicago and on the 14th spoke at Lake Bluff Camp Meeting which was under the management of Frances E Willard She then visited the summer homes of her cousins and of Elizabeth Boynton Harbert at Lake Geneva On this trip she was accompanied by her dearly-loved niece Susie B who went with her to Rochester and spent the summer The diary briefly records September 28--Left Chicago at noon and lunched with Miss Willard at Rest Cottage Evanston Her mother bright and charming at eighty-two and Anna Gordon sweet as ever It was very good to see Miss Willard under her own roof Reached Racine in time for the State convention was met by a delegation of ladies and taken to the home of Martha Parker Dingee niece of the great Theodore Parker a lovely woman Fine audiences October 2--Reached St Louis at 8 A M As I was looking for my trunk I heard some one cry out Is that you Susan? and there were Phoebe Couzins and her father I had made my trip that way for the special purpose of seeing her expecting to find her confined to the house so I went home and breakfasted with them October 4--Reached Leavenworth and found Mrs Colby and Mrs Saxon ready to begin the campaign for arousing public sentiment to demand a bill from the next legislature to secure Municipal suffrage for women Dr Ruth M Wood is the mainspring of the movement here This series of conventions was held in the congressional districts from October 5 to November 3 Mrs Laura M Johns manager assisted by Mrs Anna C Wait president of the State Association and by a number of capable and energetic Kansas women at each place visited Under date of October 11 Miss Anthony wrote to eastern friends We are having the loveliest weather you ever dreamed of and the most magnificent audiences--no church or hall holding them If our legislators State or national could only see these gatherings and look into the earnest faces of these people coming so many miles in wagons to see and hear and get fresh courage they would surely answer our demands by something else than silence The press corroborated this description and the following special dispatch may be taken as a fair specimen The seventh district convention the third of the series has just closed in Lincoln and was a beautiful ovation to Miss Anthony Crowded houses greeted her--every available foot of space filled with chairs window-sills utilized for seats and conveyances drawn up outside of windows and filled with listeners People came thirty forty and fifty miles in buggies and wagons to shake hands with the pioneer suffragist Grizzly-headed opposers succumbed to Miss Anthonys logic and came up to grasp her hand and say God bless her and proved the depth of their fervor by generous financial aid to the cause she so ably represents It is seldom that the beginner of a great reform lives to see such fruitage of her labors as does she People often descant upon the indifference of women to the question of their own enfranchisement and to political matters generally but there is serious doubt of greater interest ever having been shown by men in political meetings than women exhibit in these conventions On the evening of the second day the house was so densely packed that a messenger for a glass of water had to go out through a window But in spite of all discomfort and the many standing the audience maintained perfect order and gave the utmost attention throughout Miss Anthonys speech of two hours Learning that she would remain in Lincoln over Sunday the people importuned her to speak that afternoon in the Presbyterian church which she did to a large audience The diary relates A mother brought her four-weeks-old girl baby twenty-five miles in a carriage so she might tell it when grown that Susan B Anthony had taken it in her arms And the trip has not hurt baby a particle she said brightly And again it tells with a good deal of gusto that one Baptist minister was determined the suffrage speakers should not have his church and only yielded after several of the richest pew-holders declared they never would pay another dollar towards his salary if he did not He then made his appearance at the meeting opened it with his blessing and closed it with his benediction! Miss Anthony was not always able to speak to her own satisfaction At Salina she lectured for the Y M C A and writes I went to the opera house and found a fine audience Tried to give Moral Influence vs Political Power but the spirit wouldnt soar its wings flapped on the earth perpetually for the whole hour I took my 25 from the treasurer and went home with a heavy heart It is beyond my knowledge why after speaking every day for a whole week freely and decently my wits should desert me and my tongue be tied just at the time when I am most anxious to do my best Two days meetings were held at Abilene Florence Hutchinson Wichita Anthony Winfield Independence Lawrence and Fort Scott The speakers were entertained by prominent families suffrage societies were formed at each place the vast majority of public sentiment seemed favorable and the collections paid all the expenses of the conventions In November and December a number of other speakers made a canvass of the State and the following winter the legislature passed a bill conferring Municipal suffrage upon the women of Kansas The bill was introduced in the Senate by R W Blue Rep of Linn county and in the House by T T Taylor Rep of Reno county It passed the Senate 25 ayes all Republicans 13 noes 10 Republicans and 3 Democrats in the House 90 ayes 84 Republicans and 6 Democrats 21 noes 5 Republicans and 16 Democrats The bill was signed by Governor John A Martin February 15 1887 and under its provisions women in that State have voted ever since at Municipal elections28 Without a days rest Miss Anthony went direct from Kansas to Sandwich Ill to attend the State convention After three days there and a Sunday in Chicago Monday November 8 found her at Racine Wis ready to begin a tour of conventions in every congressional district That evening a reception was given her by Hon and Mrs M B Erskine and the hospitality of their handsome home was offered for every day which she could spend in the city With Mrs Colby and Rev Olympia Brown assisted by local speakers meetings were held at Waukesha Ripon Oshkosh Green Bay Grand Rapids Eau Claire LaCrosse Evansville Milwaukee and Madison At the last place the ladies spoke in the Senate chamber of the State House to an audience containing a number of dignitaries among them President Bascom of the State University and his wife who from this time were Miss Anthonys steadfast friends Mrs Colby gives a graphic description of Miss Anthonys sudden outburst here when several members had exasperated her by their remarks which closes I was writing at the secretarys desk and as I looked up I realized the full grandeur of the scene It was woman standing at the bar of the nation pleading for the recognition of her citizenship Miss Anthony seemed positively Titanic as she leaned far over from the speakers desk Her tone and manner were superb and the vast and sympathetic audience caught the electric thrill In this city she was the guest of an old schoolmate Elizabeth Ford Proudfit The meetings closed December 3 and Miss Anthony wrote Mrs Spofford I intend now to make straight for Washington without a stop I shall come both ragged and dirty Think of two solid months of conventions speaking every night! Dont worry about me I was never better or more full of hope and good work Though the apparel will be tattered and torn the mind the essence of me is sound to the core Please tell the little milliner to have a bonnet picked out for me and get a dressmaker who will patch me together so I shall be presentable Now for the Washington convention Before settling upon the Universalist church you would better pocket the insults and refusals of the Congregational church powers that be and send your most lovely and winning girls to ask for that If you cant get it or the Metropolitan or the Foundry or the New York Avenue or any large and popular church why take the Universalist and then tell the saints of the fashionable churches that we dwell there because they refused us admission to their holy sanctuaries Dont let us go into the heterodox houses much as I love them except because we are driven away from the orthodox In December the third volume of the History of Woman Suffrage at last was ready for the public another book of nearly 1000 pages It completed the story up to 1884 and like its predecessors was cordially received by the press The money swallowed up by this work hardly will be credited Mrs Stanton not being able or willing to revise the last volume until it was put into proof slips and then making extensive changes the cost for re-setting type was over 900 The fifty fine steel engravings and the prints made from them cost over 6000 For proof reading 500 was paid and for indexing 250 Mrs Stanton and Mrs Gage seeing that there never would be any profits from the books and that Miss Anthony proposed to give most of them away sold out their rights to her the former for 2000 and the latter for 1000 She also as has been stated bought out the interest of Fowler Wells When the first edition of the three mammoth volumes finally came into her sole possession they represented an outlay on her part of 20000 While there were many criticisms from certain quarters as to various errors and so-called misstatements and many threats to write a history which should be free from all imperfections the fact remains that although fifty years have passed since the inception of the great movement to secure equal rights for women there never has been another attempt to preserve the story But for Miss Anthonys careful collecting and saving of newspaper accounts manuscripts of speeches published reports and the correspondence of half a century her persistent and determined effort for ten years to have them put into readable shape and Mrs Stantons fine ability to do it the student never would have been able to trace the evolution of woman from a chattel in the eye of the law to a citizen with legal and social rights very nearly equal to those of man While there is necessarily some repetition so long a time elapsing between the writing of the different volumes and perhaps a little prolixity there is not a dull page in the whole work and the reader will find it difficult to reach a place where she is willing to stop It contains a resumé of early conditions the persecutions endured by the pioneers in the struggle for freedom the progress in each separate State and in foreign countries the action taken by different legislatures and congresses the grand arguments made for equal rights the position of woman in church and State Into whatever library the student may go seeking information upon this question it is to these volumes he must look to find it in collected and connected form If Miss Anthony had done no other work but to produce this History she would deserve a prominent place on the list of immortal names It was necessary to put so high a price upon it 15 a set in cloth and 1950 in leather binding as to make a large sale impossible Miss Anthony did not undertake it as a money-making scheme and when the receipt of Mrs Eddys bequest enabled her to discharge all indebtedness connected with it she felt herself at liberty to use it as a most valuable means of educating the people into an understanding of the broad principle of equality of rights At her own expense she placed the History in over 1000 of the libraries of Europe and America including the British Museum the university libraries of Oxford Edinburgh Dublin Paris Berlin Finland Melbourne Toronto and many of the university and public libraries of the United States The members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees in several Congresses were presented with sets and there are hundreds of letters on file from prominent persons in England and this country acknowledging the receipt of the books Illustration Autograph Faithfully yours H B Anthony Chapters might be made of commendatory letters received from officials writers public workers and friends in private life A few specimens must suffice A letter from Senator H B Anthony to his dear cousin closed by saying The three volumes form a valuable history of the important enterprise in which you have borne so conspicuous and honorable a part and you have added to the reputation of the name that we both bear Mary L Booth the gifted editor of Harpers Bazar thus expressed her opinion of the work You and your colleagues have industriously placed on record a copious mass of documentary evidence which will be of the utmost value when the time arrives to sum up the final results When this era comes you will be foremost among the band of heroic pioneers who have endured discomfort obloquy and privation of much that is dear to women for the sake of those who will profit by your labors while failing to recognize them Posterity will do you this justice whether your contemporaries do or not but indeed it is universally known to those with any knowledge of the facts that among all the champions of women none has been more distinguished for utter self-abnegation single-heartedness and devotion to her life-work than Susan B Anthony As you know I have always felt the deepest interest in the elevation of women which is synonymous with that of humanity for man must be always on the plane of his wife sister and mother The antagonism to political equality is rapidly disappearing as it is beginning to be recognized that in politics as in everything else womans help is needed and the republic can not afford to have her stand aloof But this phase of the subject has been so much misunderstood both by men and women that time is needed to clear away the mists of misconception which envelop it and to prove that the co-operation of women in political life is not only just and expedient but absolutely indispensable to the public weal Illustration Autograph I am now and always Yours faithfully Mary L Booth No family in Rochester stood more steadfastly by Miss Anthony during all her long and eventful life than the Wilders--Carter Samuel Mrs Maria Wilder Depuy and D Webster The last in acknowledging the receipt of the books wrote How much you have contributed to history in this grand publication! With woman as a part of humanity what a revolution will be wrought! Changes everywhere--in social life in morals politics business--and all for the better In this world-revolution you have done a great work My children are proud of the fact that you are my personal friend I fully appreciate your gift It will be a Bible in my home From the philanthropist Sarah B Cooper revered for her work in the kindergartens on the Pacific coast came this tribute This book is the fruitage of all the years of your faith and work It tells of the long preparation--the opening up of the forest the blazing of the trail the clearing of the underbrush the deep sub-soiling the lying fallow the ploughing sowing harrowing the patient tillage--and now comes the harvest What courage endurance fidelity and faith! The pioneers of new thoughts and principles are the loneliest of mortals Those who live ahead of their time must wait for the honors and plaudits of posterity to get their full meed of appreciation and reward But after all dear honored friend the richest reward of such a life as yours is to have lived it_'"
