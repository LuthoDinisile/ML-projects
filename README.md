Welcome to a collection of Data Science projects which I completed to put practical work into my understanding and knowledge of the subject matter.
These projects encompass a range of machine learning algorithms, including supervised classification, regression models, and neural networks.
Each project represents a learning journey with a focus on practical application, often using datasets sourced from Kaggle. While the work here reflects foundational skills, I aim to continually improve and expand on these projects as I grow in experience and expertise within the field.
I welcome any suggestions for refinement and am open to collaborations or invitations to contribute to data analytics projects!
